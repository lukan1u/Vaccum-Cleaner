# Network configuration
Network access control **(NAC)** is a critical part of network configuration. There are different NAC technologies:
- Discretionary access control (**DAC**) Owner/s decide who has the access
- Mandatory access control (**MAC**) - hierarchy access
- Role-based access control (**RBAC**) - prepared roles have different access polices.

**NAC enforcement** - SELinux polices, configuring AppArmour profiles, TCP wrappers for access control.
**Monitoring traffic** - syslog, syslog, ss, lsof, ELK stack
**Testing** - ping, nslookup, nmap

# Configuring network interface

Displaying all networking devices:

**ip**:
```shell-session
cry0l1t3@htb:~$ ip addr
```

**Activating network interface:**
```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ sudo ip link set eth0 up
```

**Assign IP Address to an interface**:
```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.2
```

**Assign a netmask to an interface**:
```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ sudo ifconfig eth0 netmask 255.255.255.0
```

`/etc/resolv.conf` file is the DNS server infromation
`/etc/network/uinterfaces` file defines network interfaces for linux. It should look something like this:
```txt
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
  address 192.168.1.2
  netmask 255.255.255.0
  gateway 192.168.1.1
  dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4
```

By setting the `eth0` network interface to use a static IP address of `192.168.1.2`, with a netmask of `255.255.255.0` and a default gateway of `192.168.1.1`, we can ensure that your network connection remains stable and reliable. Additionally, by specifying DNS servers of `8.8.8.8` and `8.8.4.4`, we can ensure that our computer can easily access the internet and resolve domain names. Once we have made these changes to the configuration file, saving the file and exiting the editor is important. After that, we must restart the networking service to apply the changes.

**Restart networking service**
```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ sudo systemctl restart networking
```

**Shows IP addresses of the devices that the packets pass through**:
```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ traceroute  8.8.8.8
```

# Linux security
 `/etc/hosts.allow` 
```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/hosts.allow

# Allow access to SSH from the local network
sshd : 10.129.14.0/24

# Allow access to FTP from a specific host
ftpd : 10.129.14.10

# Allow access to Telnet from any host in the inlanefreight.local domain
telnetd : .inlanefreight.local
```
`/etc/hosts.deny`
```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/hosts.deny

# Deny access to all services from any host in the inlanefreight.com domain
ALL : .inlanefreight.com

# Deny access to SSH from a specific host
sshd : 10.129.22.22

# Deny access to FTP from hosts with IP addresses in the range of 10.129.22.0 to 10.129.22.255
ftpd : 10.129.22.0/24
```
