## Steps I have taken:
### Create a new case
- Open new case and give it a name "hunter"'
- Add case information
- Backup up folder is the OneDrive (it will ask you why it's on C drive because OneDrive is on C drive)

### Add a forensic image to the case
- In the home screen find `add evidence`
- add evidence basically the `Hunter XP EO1` file

### Fun facts
- The Temp folder is used by EnCase when viewing files inside EnCase
- The Export folder is generally used to export evidence
