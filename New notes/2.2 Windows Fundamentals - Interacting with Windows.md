# Interaction with Windows
---

## Windows Sessions
- **Interactive** - Local logon session initiated by a used authenticating to a local or domain system by entering their credentials. An interactive logon can be initiated by logging directly into the system.
- **Non-interactive** - they do not require login credentials. There are 3 types: Local System Account. Local Service Account, Network Service Account. These are used by Windows to automatically start services because each service needs a "user" to start them.

| Account | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| Local System Account | Also known as the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account, this is the most powerful account in Windows systems. It is used for a variety of OS-related tasks, such as starting Windows services. This account is more powerful than accounts in the local administrators group. |
| Local Service Account | Known as the `NT AUTHORITY\LocalService` account, this is a less privileged version of the SYSTEM account and has similar privileges to a local user account. It is granted limited functionality and can start some services. |
| Network Service Account | This is known as the `NT AUTHORITY\NetworkService` account and is similar to a standard domain user account. It has similar privileges to the Local Service Account on the local machine. It can establish authenticated sessions for certain network services. |

# Interacting with the Windows Operating System
---

## Graphical User Interface
An interface that allows casual users use the PC without touching command line. It is used by the administrators to ease their work conditions.

## Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
It's a Microsoft #protocol which allows user to connect to remote system over the network. RDP uses port 3389 which sends data back and forth. Unlike SSH user is able to access GUI applications alongside the command line applications. It can be also used to access local network via virtual private network (VPN).

## Windows Command Line
Greater control over the system including admin and troubleshooting tasks. It can also be used for automation and writing scripts.

## CMD
Command Prompt is used to enter and execute commands such as ipconfig, schedule tasks or create scripts and batch files.

**How to show more detailed help** #command 
```cmd-session
ipconfig /?
```
## PowerShell
It was created mostly for system administrators. PowerShell is built on top of the .NET Framework which is used for building and running applications on Windows. Like the command prompt, PowerShell gives us direct access to the file system, and we run the majority of the same commands that we can within `a cmd shell.

## Cmdlets
PowerShell is using cmdlets which are small single function tools built into the shell. Bascially it's the commands such as `cd` and `ls`. Cmdlets are in the form **Verb-Noun**. `Get-ChildItem` is used to list current directory. `Get-ChildItem -Recurse` similar to tree.

**Display directories** #command 
```Shell
Get-ChildItem
Get-ChildItem -Recurse
Get-ChildItem -Path C:\Users\Administrator\Documents
Get-ChildItem -Path C:\Users\Administrator\Downloads -Recurse
```

## Aliases
Many cmdlets have aliases such `Set-location = cd, Get-ChildItem = ls `

**Display aliases** #command 
```powershell-session
get-alias
```

**CreateNew-Alias** #command 
```powershell-session
New-Alias -Name "Show-Files" Get-ChildItem
```

**Open Online help** #command 
```
Get-Help <cmdlet-name> -Online
```

**Installing help package** #command 
```powershell-session
Get-Help Get-AppPackage
```

# Running Scripts

PowerShell ISE (Integrated Scripting Environment) allows us to write scripts on the fly. It has autocomplete/lookup function for PowerShell commands. Scrips can be written in the same console, useful for quick debugging.

**Loading into memory with a download cradle** #command 
```powershell-session
 .\PowerView.ps1;Get-LocalGroup |fl
```
1. `.\PowerView.ps1`: This portion of the command is attempting to execute the PowerView PowerShell script. The `.\` indicates that the script is in the current directory.
    
2. `Get-LocalGroup`: This is a PowerShell cmdlet that is part of PowerView. It is used to retrieve information about local groups on a Windows system. In this context, it's likely being used to enumerate the local groups on the target system.
    
3. `|fl`: This is a pipeline operator in PowerShell. It takes the output from the previous command (`Get-LocalGroup`) and sends it as input to the next command (`fl`). `fl` is an alias for the `Format-List` cmdlet, which formats the output as a list. This is used to display the information in a more detailed format.

**Imports module like python packages in a sense** #command 
```
Import-Module .\PowerView.ps1
```

**Lists all the loaded modules and their commands** #command 
```powershell-session
Get-Module | select Name,ExportedCommands | fl
```

## Execution Policy
Execution policy will determine which commands we can run or not

|**Policy**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`AllSigned`|All scripts can run, but a trusted publisher must sign scripts and configuration files. This includes both remote and local scripts. We receive a prompt before running scripts signed by publishers that we have not yet listed as either trusted or untrusted.|
|`Bypass`|No scripts or configuration files are blocked, and the user receives no warnings or prompts.|
|`Default`|This sets the default execution policy, `Restricted` for Windows desktop machines and `RemoteSigned` for Windows servers.|
|`RemoteSigned`|Scripts can run but requires a digital signature on scripts that are downloaded from the internet. Digital signatures are not required for scripts that are written locally.|
|`Restricted`|This allows individual commands but does not allow scripts to be run. All script file types, including configuration files (`.ps1xml`), module script files (`.psm1`), and PowerShell profiles (`.ps1`) are blocked.|
|`Undefined`|No execution policy is set for the current scope. If the execution policy for ALL scopes is set to undefined, then the default execution policy of `Restricted` will be used.|
|`Unrestricted`|This is the default execution policy for non-Windows computers, and it cannot be changed. This policy allows for unsigned scripts to be run but warns the user before running scripts that are not from the local intranet zone|
**Execution policy** #command
```powershell-session
Get-ExecutionPolicy -List
```
The execution policy in PowerShell isn't a strict security measure to limit user actions. Users can easily get around it by directly typing script content into PowerShell, downloading and running scripts, or encoding and executing scripts. It can also be bypassed by adjusting the execution policy (if the user has the right permissions) or by setting the execution policy for the current session (which almost any user can do without making permanent changes).

**Changing execution policy** #command 
```powershell-session
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process
```

# Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)
WMI is a subsystem of PowerShell that provides system administrators with powerful tools and system monitoring. It consolidates device and applications management across corporate networks. It is made up of the following components:

|**Component Name**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|WMI service|The Windows Management Instrumentation process, which runs automatically at boot and acts as an intermediary between WMI providers, the WMI repository, and managing applications.|
|Managed objects|Any logical or physical components that can be managed by WMI.|
|WMI providers|Objects that monitor events/data related to a specific object.|
|Classes|These are used by the WMI providers to pass data to the WMI service.|
|Methods|These are attached to classes and allow actions to be performed. For example, methods can be used to start/stop processes on remote machines.|
|WMI repository|A database that stores all static data related to WMI.|
|CIM Object Manager|The system that requests data from WMI providers and returns it to the application requesting it.|
|WMI API|Enables applications to access the WMI infrastructure.|
|WMI Consumer|Sends queries to objects via the CIM Object Manager.|
Some of the uses for WMI are:
- Status information for local/remote systems
- Configuring security settings on remote machines/applications
- Setting and changing user and group permissions
- Setting/modifying system properties
- Code execution
- Scheduling processes
- Setting up logging

Lists information about the os #command 
```powershell-session
Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_OperatingSystem | select SystemDirectory,BuildNumber,SerialNumber,Version | ft

wmic os list brief
```


Creates new file #command 
```powershell-session
Invoke-WmiMethod -Path "CIM_DataFile.Name='C:\users\public\spns.csv'" -Name Rename -ArgumentList "C:\Users\Public\kerberoasted_users.csv"
```
- **`Invoke-WmiMethod`**: This is the cmdlet used to invoke a method of a WMI class.
- **`-Path "CIM_DataFile.Name='C:\users\public\spns.csv'"`**: Specifies the path to the instance of the WMI class on which the method should be invoked. In this case, it targets a file with the name 'spns.csv' in the 'C:\users\public' directory.
- **`-Name Rename`**: Specifies the name of the method to be invoked. In this case, it's the `Rename` method.
- **`-ArgumentList "C:\Users\Public\kerberoasted_users.csv"`**: Provides arguments to the method being invoked. Here, it specifies the new name for the file, which is 'kerberoasted_users.csv' in the 'C:\Users\Public' directory.

# Microsoft Management Console (MMC)
Is a tool to be used for group snap-ins or administrative tools to mange hardware, software and network components within a Windows host. We can use MMC to create custom tools such as snap-ins allowing administrators to create a customized console with only the administrative tools needed to manage several services.

We can open MMC by just typing `mmc` in the Start menu. When we open MMC for the first time, it will be blank.

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/49/MMC.png)

From here, we can browse to File --> `Add or Remove Snap-ins`, and begin customizing our administrative console.

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/49/MMC_add_remove.png)

As we begin adding snap-ins, we will be asked if we want to add the snap-in to manage just the local computer or if it will be used to manage another computer on the network.

# Desktop Experience vs. Server Core
Server Core has lower management requirements, a smaller attack surface, and uses less disk space and memory than its Desktop Experience (GUI) counterpart. In Server Core, all configuration and maintenance tasks are performed via the command-line, PowerShell, or remote management with MMC or Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT)

| **Application** | **Server Core** | **Desktop Experience** |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Command prompt | Available | Available |
| Windows PowerShell/ Microsoft .NET | Available | Available |
| Regedit | Available | Available |
| Diskmgmt.msc | Not Available | Available |

# Windows Security
---

## Security Identifier (SID)
- Each security principals has a unique security identifier (SID)
- System automatically generates SIDs
- Two identical user can be distinguished by Windows based on their SID
- SID are string values  stored in the security database
- SIDs are added to the user's access token to identify all actions
- SID consists of the **Identifier Authority** and the **Relative ID (RID)**. In an Active Directory (AD). The SID also includes the domain SID.

SID of a user #command 
```powershell-session
whoami /user
```
Command Explanation:
(SID)-(revision level)-(identifier-authority)-(subauthority1)-(subauthority2)-(etc)

|**Number**|**Meaning**|**Description**|
|---|---|---|
|S|SID|Identifies the string as a SID.|
|1|Revision Level|To date, this has never changed and has always been `1`.|
|5|Identifier-authority|A 48-bit string that identifies the authority (the computer or network) that created the SID.|
|21|Subauthority1|This is a variable number that identifies the user's relation or group described by the SID to the authority that created it. It tells us in what order this authority created the user's account.|
|674899381-4069889467-2080702030|Subauthority2|Tells us which computer (or domain) created the number|
|1002|Subauthority3|The RID that distinguishes one account from another. Tells us whether this user is a normal user, a guest, an administrator, or part of some other group|

## Security Accounts Manager (SAM) and Access Control Entries (ACE)

- SAM grants rights to a network to execute specific processes
- The rights themselves are manged by Access Control Entries **(ACE)** in Access Control Lists **(ACL)**.
- The ACLs contain ACEs that define which users, groups, or processes have access to a file or to execute a process.
- **Security Descriptor and Object Access Permissions**:
    - Permissions granted by the security descriptor.
    - Classified into two types of Access Control Lists (ACLs):
        - Discretionary Access Control List (DACL)
        - System Access Control List (SACL)
- **Authorization Process for Threads and Processes**:
    - Every thread and process initiated by a user undergoes an authorization process.
- **Access Tokens in the Authorization Process**:
    - Access tokens play a crucial role in the authorization process.
    - Validated by the Local Security Authority (LSA)
- **Information Contained in Access Tokens**:
    - Access tokens contain more than just Security Identifier (SID).
    - Hold other security-relevant information.

## User Account Control (UAC)

Is a security features in Windows to prevent malware and scripts from running or manipulating processes that could damage the computer. There is the Admin Approval Mode in UAC which prevents software installation without admin consent.

## Registry
Is a hierarchical database in Windows critical for the operating system. It stores low-level settings for the Windows operating system and applications that choose to use it. Divided between computer/user specific data
![[Pasted image 20240116190627.png]]

The tree-structure consists of main folders (root keys) in which subfolders (subkeys) with their entries/files (values) are located:

|**Value**|**Type**|
|---|---|
|REG_BINARY|Binary data in any form.|
|REG_DWORD|A 32-bit number.|
|REG_DWORD_LITTLE_ENDIAN|A 32-bit number in little-endian format. Windows is designed to run on little-endian computer architectures. Therefore, this value is defined as REG_DWORD in the Windows header files.|
|REG_DWORD_BIG_ENDIAN|A 32-bit number in big-endian format. Some UNIX systems support big-endian architectures.|
|REG_EXPAND_SZ|A null-terminated string that contains unexpanded references to environment variables (for example, "%PATH%"). It will be a Unicode or ANSI string depending on whether you use the Unicode or ANSI functions. To expand the environment variable references, use the [**ExpandEnvironmentStrings**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processenv/nf-processenv-expandenvironmentstringsa) function.|
|REG_LINK|A null-terminated Unicode string containing the target path of a symbolic link created by calling the [**RegCreateKeyEx**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/Winreg/nf-winreg-regcreatekeyexa) function with REG_OPTION_CREATE_LINK.|
|REG_MULTI_SZ|A sequence of null-terminated strings, terminated by an empty string (\0). The following is an example: _String1_\0_String2_\0_String3_\0_LastString_\0\0 The first \0 terminates the first string, the second to the last \0 terminates the last string, and the final \0 terminates the sequence. Note that the final terminator must be factored into the length of the string.|
|REG_NONE|No defined value type.|
|REG_QWORD|A 64-bit number.|
|REG_QWORD_LITTLE_ENDIAN|A 64-bit number in little-endian format. Windows is designed to run on little-endian computer architectures. Therefore, this value is defined as REG_QWORD in the Windows header files.|
|REG_SZ|A null-terminated string. This will be either a Unicode or an ANSI string, depending on whether you use the Unicode or ANSI functions.|
- Each folder under Computer is a key.
- The root keys start with HKEY
- HKEY-LOCAL-MACHINE abbreviated to HKLM
- HKLM contains all settings relevant to the local system.
	- This root key contains six subkeys like SAM, SECURITY, SYSTEM, SOFTWARE, HARDWARE, BCD loaded into memory at boot time except HARDWARE which is dynamically loaded.

Entire system registry #command 
`C:\Windows\System32\Config\`.

The user-specific registry hive HKCU is stored in the user folder `C:\Users\<USERNAME>\Ntuser.dat`
To view hidden files in PowerShell: #command 
```powershell-session
gci -Hidden
```

## Run and RunOnce Registry Keys

Run and RunOnce registry keys are hives which contain logical group of keys, subkeys that support software and files loaded into memory when OS is started or user logs in. Useful for maintaining access to the system

The Windows registry includes the following four keys:
```powershell-session
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce
```

How to run Registry Keys #command 
```powershell-session
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
```

## Application Whitelisting

- Whitelist is a list of approved software apps or executables allowed to be present and run on a system.
- Whitelist should be implemented in audit mode initially to make sure that all necessary applications are whitelisted and not blocked by an error of omission.
- Blacklisting specified list of harmful or disallowed software/apps to block.

Whitelisting is recommended by organisation such as NIST especially in high-security environments.

## App locker
App locker is Microsoft's application whitelisting solution and was first introduced in Windows 7. AppLocker controls applications and files users can run such as executables, scripts, Windows installer files, DLLs packed apps and packed app installers.

Settings can be adjusted by
- Publishers name
- Digital Signature
- Product name
- File name and version.
- Hashes and file paths.

## Local Group Policy
Group Policy allows administrators to set, configure and adjust a variety of settings. In a domain environment, group policies are pushed down from a domain controller onto all domain-joined machines that group policy objects (**GPOs**) are linked. These settings can also be defined on individual machines using local group policy.

- Group polices can be configured locally, in both domain and non domain environments.
- Can tweak graphical and network settings.
- Can lock down an individual computer policy with stringent security settings such as allowing certain programs to be installed.

Local Group Policy Editor #command 
```
gpedit.msc
```

The editor splits into *two* categories.
- User configuration
- Computer configuration
![[Pasted image 20240123234841.png]]

We can user Local Computer Policy to enable Credential Guard by enabling `Turn On Virtualization Based Security`. This protects against credential theft attacks.
![[Pasted image 20240123235045.png]]


## Windows Defender
Check Windows Defender protection #command 
```powershell-session
Get-MpComputerStatus | findstr "True"
```
