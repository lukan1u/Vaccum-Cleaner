# Interaction with Windows

## Windows Sessions
- **Interactive** - Local logon session initiated by a used authenticating to a local or domain system by entering their credentials. An interactive logon can be initiated by logging directly into the system.
- **Non-interactive** - they do not require login credentials. There are 3 types: Local System Account. Local Service Account, Network Service Account. These are used by Windows to automatically start services because each service needs a "user" to start them.

| Account | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| Local System Account | Also known as the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account, this is the most powerful account in Windows systems. It is used for a variety of OS-related tasks, such as starting Windows services. This account is more powerful than accounts in the local administrators group. |
| Local Service Account | Known as the `NT AUTHORITY\LocalService` account, this is a less privileged version of the SYSTEM account and has similar privileges to a local user account. It is granted limited functionality and can start some services. |
| Network Service Account | This is known as the `NT AUTHORITY\NetworkService` account and is similar to a standard domain user account. It has similar privileges to the Local Service Account on the local machine. It can establish authenticated sessions for certain network services. |

## Graphical User Interface
An interface that allows casual users use the PC without touching command line. It is used by the administrators to ease their work conditions.

## Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
It's a Microsoft #protocol which allows user to connect to remote system over the network. RDP uses port 3389 which sends data back and forth. Unlike SSH user is able to access GUI applications alongside the command line applications. It can be also used to access local network via virtual private network (VPN).

## Windows Command Line
Greater control over the system including admin and troubleshooting tasks. It can also be used for automation and writing scripts.

## CMD
Command Prompt is used to enter and execute commands such as ipconfig, schedule tasks or create scripts and batch files.

**How to show more detailed help** #command 
```cmd-session
ipconfig /?
```
## PowerShell
It was created mostly for system administrators. PowerShell is built on top of the .NET Framework which is used for building and running applications on Windows. Like the command prompt, PowerShell gives us direct access to the file system, and we run the majority of the same commands that we can within a cmd shell.

## Cmdlets
PowerShell is using cmdlets which are small single function tools built into the shell. Bascially it's the commands such as `cd` and `ls`. Cmdlets are in the form **Verb-Noun**. `Get-ChildItem` is used to list current directory. `Get-ChildItem -Recurse` similar to tree.

**Display directories** #command 
```Shell
Get-ChildItem
Get-ChildItem -Recurse
Get-ChildItem -Path C:\Users\Administrator\Documents
Get-ChildItem -Path C:\Users\Administrator\Downloads -Recurse
```

## Aliases
Many cmdlets have aliases such `Set-location = cd, Get-ChildItem = ls `

**Display aliases** #command 
```powershell-session
get-alias
```

**CreateNew-Alias** #command 
```powershell-session
New-Alias -Name "Show-Files" Get-ChildItem
```

**Open Online help** #command 
```
Get-Help <cmdlet-name> -Online
```

**Installing help package** #command 
```powershell-session
Get-Help Get-AppPackage
```

# Running Scripts

PowerShell ISE (Integrated Scripting Environment) allows us to write scripts on the fly. It has autocomplete/lookup function for PowerShell commands. Scrips can be written in the same console, useful for quick debugging.

**Loading into memory with a download cradle** #command 
```powershell-session
 .\PowerView.ps1;Get-LocalGroup |fl
```
1. `.\PowerView.ps1`: This portion of the command is attempting to execute the PowerView PowerShell script. The `.\` indicates that the script is in the current directory.
    
2. `Get-LocalGroup`: This is a PowerShell cmdlet that is part of PowerView. It is used to retrieve information about local groups on a Windows system. In this context, it's likely being used to enumerate the local groups on the target system.
    
3. `|fl`: This is a pipeline operator in PowerShell. It takes the output from the previous command (`Get-LocalGroup`) and sends it as input to the next command (`fl`). `fl` is an alias for the `Format-List` cmdlet, which formats the output as a list. This is used to display the information in a more detailed format.

**Imports module like python packages in a sense** #command 
```
Import-Module .\PowerView.ps1
```

**Lists all the loaded modules and their commands** #command 
```powershell-session
Get-Module | select Name,ExportedCommands | fl
```

## Execution Policy
Execution policy will determine which commands we can run or not

|**Policy**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`AllSigned`|All scripts can run, but a trusted publisher must sign scripts and configuration files. This includes both remote and local scripts. We receive a prompt before running scripts signed by publishers that we have not yet listed as either trusted or untrusted.|
|`Bypass`|No scripts or configuration files are blocked, and the user receives no warnings or prompts.|
|`Default`|This sets the default execution policy, `Restricted` for Windows desktop machines and `RemoteSigned` for Windows servers.|
|`RemoteSigned`|Scripts can run but requires a digital signature on scripts that are downloaded from the internet. Digital signatures are not required for scripts that are written locally.|
|`Restricted`|This allows individual commands but does not allow scripts to be run. All script file types, including configuration files (`.ps1xml`), module script files (`.psm1`), and PowerShell profiles (`.ps1`) are blocked.|
|`Undefined`|No execution policy is set for the current scope. If the execution policy for ALL scopes is set to undefined, then the default execution policy of `Restricted` will be used.|
|`Unrestricted`|This is the default execution policy for non-Windows computers, and it cannot be changed. This policy allows for unsigned scripts to be run but warns the user before running scripts that are not from the local intranet zone|
**Execution policy** #command
```powershell-session
Get-ExecutionPolicy -List
```
The execution policy in PowerShell isn't a strict security measure to limit user actions. Users can easily get around it by directly typing script content into PowerShell, downloading and running scripts, or encoding and executing scripts. It can also be bypassed by adjusting the execution policy (if the user has the right permissions) or by setting the execution policy for the current session (which almost any user can do without making permanent changes).

**Changing execution policy** #command 
```powershell-session
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process
```

# Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)
WMI is a subsystem of PowerShell that provides system administrators with powerful tools and system monitoring. It consolidates device and applications management across corporate networks. It is made up of the following components:

|**Component Name**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|WMI service|The Windows Management Instrumentation process, which runs automatically at boot and acts as an intermediary between WMI providers, the WMI repository, and managing applications.|
|Managed objects|Any logical or physical components that can be managed by WMI.|
|WMI providers|Objects that monitor events/data related to a specific object.|
|Classes|These are used by the WMI providers to pass data to the WMI service.|
|Methods|These are attached to classes and allow actions to be performed. For example, methods can be used to start/stop processes on remote machines.|
|WMI repository|A database that stores all static data related to WMI.|
|CIM Object Manager|The system that requests data from WMI providers and returns it to the application requesting it.|
|WMI API|Enables applications to access the WMI infrastructure.|
|WMI Consumer|Sends queries to objects via the CIM Object Manager.|
Some of the uses for WMI are:
- Status information for local/remote systems
- Configuring security settings on remote machines/applications
- Setting and changing user and group permissions
- Setting/modifying system properties
- Code execution
- Scheduling processes
- Setting up logging

Lists information about the os #command 
```powershell-session
Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_OperatingSystem | select SystemDirectory,BuildNumber,SerialNumber,Version | ft

wmic os list brief
```


Creates new file #command 
```powershell-session
Invoke-WmiMethod -Path "CIM_DataFile.Name='C:\users\public\spns.csv'" -Name Rename -ArgumentList "C:\Users\Public\kerberoasted_users.csv"
```
- **`Invoke-WmiMethod`**: This is the cmdlet used to invoke a method of a WMI class.
- **`-Path "CIM_DataFile.Name='C:\users\public\spns.csv'"`**: Specifies the path to the instance of the WMI class on which the method should be invoked. In this case, it targets a file with the name 'spns.csv' in the 'C:\users\public' directory.
- **`-Name Rename`**: Specifies the name of the method to be invoked. In this case, it's the `Rename` method.
- **`-ArgumentList "C:\Users\Public\kerberoasted_users.csv"`**: Provides arguments to the method being invoked. Here, it specifies the new name for the file, which is 'kerberoasted_users.csv' in the 'C:\Users\Public' directory.
