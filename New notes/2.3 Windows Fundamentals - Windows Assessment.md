5. Adding Jim to the HR security group
6. Adding the HR security group to the shared Company Data folder and NTFS permissions list
- `Remove the default group that is present`
- `Share Permissions: Allow Change & Read`
- `Disable Inheritance before issuing specific NTFS permissions`
- `NTFS permissions: Modify, Read & Execute, List folder contents, Read, Write`

7. Adding the HR security group to the NTFS permissions list of the HR subfolder
- `Remove the default group that is present`
- `Disable Inheritance before issuing specific NTFS permissions`
- `NTFS permissions: Modify, Read & Execute, List folder contents, Read, and Write`

8. Using PowerShell to list details about a service


## Solution
- Using properties on a folder we are using sharing and security tabs to finished the tasks
	- When assign user to a group etc remember to check names to create proper references
- Computer Management is better way of adding users and groups


To display services by their display name #command 
```
Get-Service -DisplayName 'DisplayName'
```


Get SID of users and groups #command 
```
Get-WmiObject Win32_UserAccount | Select-Object Name, SID
Get-WmiObject Win32_Group | Select-Object Name, SID
```
