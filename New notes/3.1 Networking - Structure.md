# Introduction

**Topologies** - Mesh, tree, star
**Medium** - ethernet, fiber, coax, wireless
**Protocols** - TCP, UDP, IPX

On a network computer can talk to each other as long as `192.168.1.xxx` is the same except the xxx with /24 as default subnet mask.
Adding subnet mask `/25` will divide network where devices with that subnet will be able to communicate with each other but not anything else.

The difference between `URL`s and `FQDN`s is that:
- an `FQDN` (`www.hackthebox.eu`) only specifies the address of the "building" and
- an `URL` (`https://www.hackthebox.eu/example?floor=2&office=dev&employee=17`) also specifies the "`floor`," "`office`," "`mailbox`" and the corresponding "`employee`" for whom the package is intended.

We do not know the exact geographical location of the address but here is why we need ISP because in this scenario they would be like a post office that has all information needed to reach the correct address. Router communicates with ISP and ISP communicates with other networks.

As soon as we send our packet through our post office (`router`), the packet is forwarded to the `main post office` (`ISP`). This main post office looks in the `address register`/`phonebook` (`Domain Name Service`) where this address is located and returns the corresponding geographical coordinates (`IP address`). Now that we know the address's exact location, our packet is sent directly there by a direct flight via our main post office.

1. The Web Server should be in a DMZ (Demilitarized Zone). It should be placed in separate network because clients and directly communicate with the server which can be compromised.
2. Workstations should be on their own network and each workstation should have a Host Based Firewall rule preventing it from talking to other workstations.
3. The Switch and Router should be on an "Administration Network" This prevents workstations from snooping in on any communications between these devices.
4. IP Phones should be on their own network. Security- wise this is to prevent computers from being able to eavesdrop on communication.
5. Printers should be on their own network.

# Network types

|**Network Type**|**Definition**|
|---|---|
|Wide Area Network (WAN)|Internet|
|Local Area Network (LAN)|Internal Networks (Ex: Home or Office)|
|Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)|Internal Networks accessible over Wi-Fi|
|Virtual Private Network (VPN)|Connects multiple network sites to one `LAN`|
**WAN** - is usually refereed as the Internet. WAN is the address  with large number of LANs joined together. Many governments or large companies will have an "Internal WAN" (also called Intranet Airgap Network). To identify WAN is to use WAN specific routing protocols such as BGP and if the IP Schema is in use is not within RFC 1918.

LAN / WLAN -
