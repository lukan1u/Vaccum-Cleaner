## Steps I have taken:
### Create a new case
- Open new case and give it a name "hunter"'
- Add case information
- Backup up folder is the OneDrive (it will ask you why it's on C drive because OneDrive is on C drive)

### Add a forensic image to the case
- In the home screen find `add evidence`
- add evidence basically the `Hunter XP EO1` file
- double click on Hunter XP to see evidence

### Navigating through the encase
- Green plating allows you to switch focus to the particular folder and work within this one folder.
- It panels works similar to those in windows
- Bookmarking works by ticking the boxes

## Autopsy
- Create new case

- Set time zone on London
- Interface similar to the one of encase although bit more plain
