## What is Digital forensics
---
- **Digital forensics** - is the applications of science to law and is ultimately tested by use in court. The systematic study of digital data becomes a forensic discipline when it relates to the investigation and prosecution of a crime. Post incident analysis relates to digital forensics.
- **Forensic** we mean a characteristic of evidence that satisfied its suitability for admission as fact and its ability to persuade based upon proof (or high statistical confidence). Major decision are based on evidence.
- **Forensic Science** is the application of science to law and is ultimately tested by use in court
	- The systematic study of digital data becomes a forensic discipline when **it relates to the investigation** and prosecution of a crime

- **Digital Forensics Science** (full definition) - The use of **scientifically derived and proven methods** toward the  preservation, collection, validation, identification, analysis,  interpretation, documentation and presentation of digital evidence  derived from digital sources for the purpose of facilitating or  furthering the reconstruction of events found to be criminal, or  helping to anticipate unauthorized actions shown to be disruptive to  planned operations.

#### Crime breakdown
1. **Object of a crime** (stolen destroyed)
2. **Subject of crime** (computer infected by malware)
3. **Tool for conduction** or planning a crime
4. **Symbol** to create false impression (especially in the financial sector)
#### Participles of digital forensics
Forensic Science is a field of study that involves the application of scientific methods to investigate legal cases. It provides a wide range of investigative techniques and methods that have been proven to achieve reliable results. Forensic evidence is characterized by its suitability for admission as fact and its ability to persuade based upon proof or high statistical confidence
- Decisions are based on **solid evidence**
- "**Certainty**" should be **used with extra care** as we cannot always proof of what actually has happend.

There are *3 categories* for digital evidence:
- **Open computer systems**  - (hard drives laptops, desktops)
- **Communications systems**  - (traditional telephone systems wireless communications system SMS messages)
- **Embedded computer systems**  - mobile devices, smart cards, activity trackers wearable watches



**Specialist fields:**
1. Computer forensics - preservation and analysis of computers also called file sytem forensics
2. Network forensics - preservation and analysis of traffic and logs from networks
3. mobile device forensics - preservation and analysis of cell phones and smart phones and satellite navigation
4. malware forensics
5. cloud forensics
