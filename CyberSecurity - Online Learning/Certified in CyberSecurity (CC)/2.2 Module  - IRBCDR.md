## What is BCP (Business Continuity Plan)?
**The overall goal of BCP is to keep the business running during or after the crisis** and to minimise the effects of the disaster or incident by having well designed back up plan that will protect CIA triads and customers as well as employees.

- The main common components are:
	- List of all BCP members inc different contact methods and back up members.
	- Immediate response procedures and check lists (emergency agencies, fire suppression methods, security and safety procedures).
	- Notification system and call tree.
	- Guidance for management.
	- It's important to include when and how the plan will be used.
	- Contact third party partners and customers.
