## Understand Network Security Infrastructure
---
- **Data centre is usually a server room with all the hardware**. A standard room will include:
	- Heating, **ventilation and air conditioning**  (HVAC system). It's essential to record accurate temperature to maximise lifespan of the computer hardware.
	- Data centre include: Phone, network, special connections, ISP, server, wring and switch components and all of those need to be protected.
	- **Power**, additional power sources should be installed in place since it may be critical for running business operations. Additional batteries back up generators etc.
	- Fire a in a case of fire since we are working with high power devices that can generate a lot of heat.

## Redundancy
---
- A simple concept of installing multiple components in the same system so that in a case of failure there is a back up.

## Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)/Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) 
---
- Some organizations seeking to minimize downtime and enhance BC (Business Continuity) and DR (Disaster Recovery) capabilities will create agreements with other, similar organizations. They agree that if one of the parties experiences an emergency and cannot operate within their own facility, the other party will share its resources and let them operate within theirs in order to maintain critical functions. These agreements often even include competitors, because their facilities and resources meet the needs of their particular industry.
- These agreements are called joint operating agreements (JOA) or memoranda of understanding (MOU) or memoranda of agreement (MOA). Sometimes these agreements are mandated by regulatory requirements, or they might just be part of the administrative safeguards instituted by an entity within the guidelines of its industry. 
- The difference between an MOA or MOU  and an SLA is that a Memorandum of Understanding is more directly related to what can be done with a system or the information.

## Cloud
---
- **Cloud computing** - internet based computing resource typically sold as a service. It can be networks, servers, storage, applications and services.
- Typical **cloud characteristics**:
	- Usage is metered and priced according to units consumed
	- Reduced cost of ownership (no need for maintenance  as it is done by the physical owner)
	- Reduced energy and cooling costs, along with “green IT” environment effect with optimum
	- Allows an enterprise to scale up new software or data-based services/solutions
	- Cloud good be used for databases or resource polling to maximise the on raw output.

- There are type of *cloud computing models* and these include:
	- **Software as a service** - customer users cloud provider applications within a cloud infrastructure. The applications are available to customers via thin client interface such as through web browser or program interface.
	- **Platform as a service** - Cloud provides environment for the business to run their own software. It's essentially a way for a business to rent hardware however customers do not own and manage cloud underlying infrastructure.
	- **Infrastructure as a Service** - usually means a data centre that includes anything that platform as service offered but with infrastructure (core components of the cloud that make itself available)  included.
- There different types of *deployment*:
	- **Public** - cloud for the public user where user pays for his needs and access to the resources. Often it is done with a pool where many users will share same hardware. Consumers can rent hardware from CSP.
	- **Private** - clouds begin with the same technical concept as public clouds, except that instead of being shared with the public, they are generally developed and deployed for a private organization that builds its own cloud. The organisation is also usually responsible for all the maintenance.
	- A **hybrid cloud** benefits: retaining ownership and oversight of critical tasks and processes related to technology, Reusing previous investments in technology within the organization, Control over most critical business components and systems, and Cost-effective means to fulfilling noncritical business functions (utilizing public cloud components).
	- Community clouds - they're different because they are made for specific community or sectors. A community cloud focused on financial services is a great example of it.
### Manged service provider (MSP)
- **MSP** is another company that **manages information technology assets for another company**. Small and medium sizes companies usually outsource part of their information technology functions to MSP to manage day-to-day operations and provide expertise in areas company does not have.
- MSPs offer cloud-based services **augmenting SaaS solutions** with active incident investigation and response activities.
- Some other common MSP implementations are: 
	- Augment in-house staff for projects
	- Utilize expertise for implementation of a product or service
	- Provide payroll services
	- Provide Help Desk service management
	- Monitor and respond to security incidents
	- **Detection and response (MDR) service**
	- Manage all in-house IT infrastructure

### Service-Level Agreement (SLA)
- The cloud computing service-level agreement is an **agreement between CSP and customer** based on specific terms to set the quality of cloud services being delivered.
- It's like **rule book or legal contract**
- The SLA contract scope includes things like: **data ownership, minimum service availability, remedies for failure, data return/destruction.** It could also include things like these:
	- Cloud system infrastructure details and security standards
	- Customer right to audit legal and regulatory compliance by the CSP         
	- Rights and costs associated with continuing and discontinuing service use
	- Service availability
	- Service performance
	- Data security and privacy
	- Disaster recovery processes
	- Data location
	- Data access
	- Data portability
	- Problem identification and resolution expectations
	- Change management processes
	- Dispute mediation processes
	- Exit strategy

## Network Design
---
There are several elements when planning for security in a network:
- **Network segmentation** - involves controlling traffic among networked devices. Physical network segmentation occurs when a network is isolated for all outside communications so transacations can only occur between devices within the segmented network.![[Pasted image 20231003221444.png]]

- **Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)** - is network area that is designed to be accessed byu outside visitors but is still isolated from the private network of the organisations. Often DNZ is ahost of public web, email servers.![[Pasted image 20231003221920.png]]
- **Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN)** - are created by switches to logically segment a networking without altering its physical topology. They keep network applications separate while still being on the same network for example if some devices need physical connection while other wireless. ![[Pasted image 20231003222413.png]]
- **Virtual Private Network (VPN)** - is a communication tunnel that provides point-to-point transmission of both authentication and data traffic over an untrusted network.![[Pasted image 20231003222501.png]]
- **Defence in depth** uses multiple types of access control in literal or theoretical layers to help an organization avoid a monolithic security stance 
- **Network Access Control (NAC)**  -  is a concept of controlling access to an environment through strict adherence to and implementation of security policy.

### Defence in Depth
![[Pasted image 20231003223747.png]]
- It uses **layered approach** when designing the security posture of the organisation. Using analogy of castle to protect it's jewels it uses a chess that is within a vault hidden behind thick walls guarded by wall guards.
- It's s**tarting point of designing the security of a system** in terms of administrative, technological and physical connections to provide efficient protection for an organisation

- *Bit in depth info*:
	- **Data:** Controls that protect the actual data with technologies such as encryption, data leak prevention, identity and access management and data controls.
	- **Application**: Controls that protect the application itself with technologies such as data leak prevention, application firewalls and database monitors.
	- **Host**: Every control that is placed at the endpoint level, such as antivirus, endpoint firewall, configuration and patch management.
	- **Internal network**: Controls that are in place to protect uncontrolled data flow and user access across the organizational network. Relevant technologies include intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, internal firewalls and network access controls.
	- **Perimeter**: Controls that protect against unauthorized access to the network. This level includes the use of technologies such as gateway firewalls, honeypots, malware analysis and secure demilitarized zones (DMZs).
	- **Physical**: Controls that provide a physical barrier, such as locks, walls or access control.
	- **Policies, procedures and awareness:** Administrative controls that reduce insider threats (intentional and unintentional) and identify risks as soon as they appear.

### Zero Trust
- Zero trust networks are **micro segmented network** with firewalls at nearly every connecting point. Even if the user has high-privileges he will have to **reverify itself several times** to access every segmented network. It's called **trust but verify environment** concept. This increases the number of opportunities to detect a troublemakers before it gains too much access.
- Even best control systems have their weakness. Zero trust network **adds defences at the user, asset and data level**.
- The difference between micro segmentation and zero trust network is that **micro segmentation adds additional internal perimeters** (network) while **zero trust focuses on more effective gates** at each and every single perimeter (network)![[EDU-ELCC-70530-techart-zero_trust-v02.svg]]
### Network Access Control (NAC)
- **The NAC device** will provide the network visibility needed for access security and may later be used for incident response. Aside from **identifying connections**, it should also be able to **provide isolation for noncompliant devices** within a quarantined network and provide a **mechanism to “fix” the noncompliant elements**, such as turning on endpoint protection. In short, the goal is to ensure that all devices wishing to join the network do so only when they comply with the requirements laid out in the organization policies. This visibility will encompass internal users as well as any temporary users such as guests or contractors, etc., and any devices they may bring with them into the organization.
- NAC can require use or enforce software installation to comply with network security policies in order to be admitted into the network
- Use cases for **NAC deployment:** 
	- Medical devices
	- IoT devices
	- BYOD/mobile devices (laptops, tablets, smartphones) personal devices
	- Guest users and contractors

### Network Segmentation (Demilitarized Zone (DMZ))
- **Network segmentation** is also an effective **way to achieve defense in depth** for distributed or multi-tiered applications. The use of a demilitarized zone (DMZ), for example, is a common practice in security architecture. With a DMZ, host systems that are accessible through the firewall are physically **separated from the internal network by means of secured switches** **or by using an additional firewall to control traffic** between the web server and the internal network. Application DMZs (or semi-trusted networks) are frequently used today to limit access to application servers to those networks or systems that have a legitimate need to connect.
- *Analogy:* DMZ is like a special box where some people are allowed to interact with. It has additional wall or a fence on a way.  Network segmentation divides computer networks into smaller parts with it own set of rules for who can access it
![[EDU-ELCC-70370-dmz-v02.svg]]

### Segmentation for Embedded Systems and IoT
- **Embedded system** is a computer that is part of a **bigger system**. It's usually a component that specific use case that to function it needs main system. Examples of embedded systems include network-attached printers, smart TVs, HVAC controls, smart appliances, smart thermostats and medical devices.
- **Network-enabled** devices include smartphones, mobile phones, tablets, smart TVs or streaming media players
- **The Internet of Things (IoT)** is the collection of devices that can communicate over the internet with one another or with a control console in order to affect and monitor the real world. IoT devices might be labeled as smart devices or smart-home equipment.
- **Embedded systems and network-enabled** devices that communicate with the internet are **considered IoT devices** and need special attention to ensure that communication is not used in a malicious manner.![[EDU-ELCC-70535-techart-segmentation_embedded_systems_iot-v04.svg]]
### Microsegmentation
The toolsets of current adversaries are polymorphic in nature and allow threats to bypass static security controls. Modern cyberattacks take advantage of traditional security models to move easily between systems within a data center. Microsegmentation aids in protecting against these threats. A fundamental design requirement of microsegmentation is to understand the protection requirements for traffic within a data center and traffic to and from the internet traffic flows.

### Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN)

**Virtual local area networks (VLANs)** allow network administrators to use switches to create software-based LAN segments, which can segregate or consolidate traffic across multiple switch ports. Devices that share a VLAN communicate through switches as if they were on the same Layer 2 network. This image shows different VLANs — red, green and blue — connecting separate sets of ports together, while sharing the same network segment (consisting of the two switches and their connection). Since VLANs act as discrete networks, communications between VLANs must be enabled. Broadcast traffic is limited to the VLAN, reducing congestion and reducing the effectiveness of some attacks. Administration of the environment is simplified, as the VLANs can be reconfigured when individuals change their physical location or need access to different services. VLANs can be configured based on switch port, IP subnet, MAC address and protocols.

VLANs do not guarantee a network’s security. At first glance, it may seem that traffic cannot be intercepted because communication within a VLAN is restricted to member devices. However, there are attacks that allow a malicious user to see traffic from other VLANs (so-called VLAN hopping). The VLAN technology is only one tool that can improve the overall security of the network environment.

### Virtual Private Network (VPN)

A virtual private network (VPN) is not necessarily an encrypted tunnel. It is simply a point-to-point connection between two hosts that allows them to communicate. Secure communications can, of course, be provided by the VPN, but only if the security protocols have been selected and correctly configured to provide a trusted path over an untrusted network, such as the internet. Remote users employ VPNs to access their organization’s network, and depending on the VPN’s implementation, they may have most of the same resources available to them as if they were physically at the office. As an alternative to expensive dedicated point-to-point connections, organizations use gateway-to-gateway VPNs to securely transmit information over the internet between sites or even with business partners.
