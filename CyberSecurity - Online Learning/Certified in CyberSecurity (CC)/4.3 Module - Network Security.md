## Understand Network Security Infrastructure
---
- **Data centre is usually a server room with all the hardware**. A standard room will include:
	- Heating, **ventilation and air conditioning**  (HVAC system). It's essential to record accurate temperature to maximise lifespan of the computer hardware.
	- Data centre include: Phone, network, special connections, ISP, server, wring and switch components and all of those need to be protected.
	- **Power**, additional power sources should be installed in place since it may be critical for running business operations. Additional batteries back up generators etc.
	- Fire a in a case of fire since we are working with high power devices that can generate a lot of heat.

## Redundancy
---
- A simple concept of installing multiple components in the same system so that in a case of failure there is a back up.

## Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)/Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) 
---
- Some organizations seeking to minimize downtime and enhance BC (Business Continuity) and DR (Disaster Recovery) capabilities will create agreements with other, similar organizations. They agree that if one of the parties experiences an emergency and cannot operate within their own facility, the other party will share its resources and let them operate within theirs in order to maintain critical functions. These agreements often even include competitors, because their facilities and resources meet the needs of their particular industry.
- These agreements are called joint operating agreements (JOA) or memoranda of understanding (MOU) or memoranda of agreement (MOA). Sometimes these agreements are mandated by regulatory requirements, or they might just be part of the administrative safeguards instituted by an entity within the guidelines of its industry. 
- The difference between an MOA or MOU  and an SLA is that a Memorandum of Understanding is more directly related to what can be done with a system or the information.

## Cloud
---
- **Cloud computing** - internet based computing resource typically sold as a service. It can be networks, servers, storage, applications and services.
- Typical cloud characteristics:
	- Usage is metered and priced according to units consumed
	- Reduced cost of ownership (no need for maintenance  as it is done by the physical owner)
	- Reduced energy and cooling costs, along with “green IT” environment effect with optimum
	- Allows an enterprise to scale up new software or data-based services/solutions
	- Cloud good be used for databases or resource polling to maximise the on raw output.

- There are type of *cloud computing models* and these include:
	- **Software as a service** - customer users cloud provider applications within a cloud infrastructure. The applications are available to customers via thin client interface such as through web browser or program interface.
	- **Platform as a service** - Cloud provides environment for the business to run their own software. It's essentially a way for a business to rent hardware however customers do not own and manage cloud underlying infrastructure.
	- **Infrastructure as a Service** - usually means a data centre that includes anything that platform as service offered but with infrastructure (core components of the cloud that make itself available)  included.
- There different types of *deployment*:
	- **Public** - cloud for the public user where user pays for his needs and access to the resources. Often it is done with a pool where many users will share same hardware. Consumers can rent hardware from CSP.
	- **Private** - clouds begin with the same technical concept as public clouds, except that instead of being shared with the public, they are generally developed and deployed for a private organization that builds its own cloud. The organisation is also usually responsible for all the maintenance.
	- A **hybrid cloud** benefits: retaining ownership and oversight of critical tasks and processes related to technology, Reusing previous investments in technology within the organization, Control over most critical business components and systems, and Cost-effective means to fulfilling noncritical business functions (utilizing public cloud components).
	- Community clouds - they're different because they are made for specific community or sectors. A community cloud focused on financial services is a great example of it.
### Manged service provider (MSP)
- **MSP** is another company that **manages information technology assets for another company**. Small and medium sizes companies usually outsource part of their information technology functions to MSP to manage day-to-day operations and provide expertise in areas company does not have.
- MSPs offer cloud-based services **augmenting SaaS solutions** with active incident investigation and response activities.
- Some other common MSP implementations are: 
	- Augment in-house staff for projects
	- Utilize expertise for implementation of a product or service
	- Provide payroll services
	- Provide Help Desk service management
	- Monitor and respond to security incidents
	- **Detection and response (MDR) service**
	- Manage all in-house IT infrastructure

### Service-Level Agreement (SLA)
- The cloud computing service-level agreement is an **agreement between CSP and customer** based on specific terms to set the quality of cloud services being delivered.
- It's like **rule book or legal contract**
- The SLA contract scope includes things like: **data ownership, minimum service availability, remedies for failure, data return/destruction.** It could also include things like these:
	- Cloud system infrastructure details and security standards
	- Customer right to audit legal and regulatory compliance by the CSP         
	- Rights and costs associated with continuing and discontinuing service use
	- Service availability
	- Service performance
	- Data security and privacy
	- Disaster recovery processes
	- Data location
	- Data access
	- Data portability
	- Problem identification and resolution expectations
	- Change management processes
	- Dispute mediation processes
	- Exit strategy

## Network Design
---
There are several elements when planning for security in a network:
- Network segmentation
