## Understand Network Security Infrastructure
---
- Data centre is usually a server room with all the hardware. A standard room will include:
	- Heating, ventilation and air conditioning  (HVAC system). It's essential to record accurate temperature to maximise lifespan of the computer hardware.
	- Data centre include: Phone, network, special connections, ISP, server, wring and switch components and all of those need to be protected.
	- Power, additional power sources should be installed in place since it may be critical for running business operations. Additional batteries back up generators etc.
	- Fire a in a case of fire since we are working with high power devices that can generate a lot of heat.

## Redundancy
---
- A simple concept of installing multiple components in the same system so that in a case of failure there is a back up.

## Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)/Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) 
---
- Some organizations seeking to minimize downtime and enhance BC (Business Continuity) and DR (Disaster Recovery) capabilities will create agreements with other, similar organizations. They agree that if one of the parties experiences an emergency and cannot operate within their own facility, the other party will share its resources and let them operate within theirs in order to maintain critical functions. These agreements often even include competitors, because their facilities and resources meet the needs of their particular industry.
- These agreements are called joint operating agreements (JOA) or memoranda of understanding (MOU) or memoranda of agreement (MOA). Sometimes these agreements are mandated by regulatory requirements, or they might just be part of the administrative safeguards instituted by an entity within the guidelines of its industry. 
- The difference between an MOA or MOU  and an SLA is that a Memorandum of Understanding is more directly related to what can be done with a system or the information.

## Cloud
---
- **Cloud computing** - internet based computing resource typically sold as a service. It can be networks, servers, storage, applications and services.
- Typical cloud characteristics:

- Cloud good be used for databases or resource polling to maximise the on raw output.
