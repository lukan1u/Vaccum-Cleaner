## Understand Security Awareness Training
---
To reduce the effectiveness of certain types of attacks (such as social engineering), it is crucial that the organization informs its employees and staff how to recognize security problems and how to operate in a secure manner. While the specifics of secure operation differ in each organization, there are some general concepts that are applicable to all such programs.

# Purpose

The purpose of awareness training is to make sure everyone knows what is expected of them, based on responsibilities and accountabilities, and to find out if there is any carelessness or complacency that may pose a risk to the organization. We will be able to align the information security goals with the organization’s missions and vision and have a better sense of what the environment is.

# What is Security Awareness Training?

Let’s start with a clear understanding of the three different types of learning activities that organizations use, whether for information security or for any other purpose:

- **Education**: The overall goal of education is to help learners improve their understanding of these ideas and their ability to relate them to their own experiences and apply that learning in useful ways.
- **Training**: Focuses on building proficiency in a specific set of skills or actions, including sharpening the perception and judgment needed to make decisions as to which skill to use, when to use it and how to apply it. Training can focus on low-level skills, an entire task or complex workflows consisting of many tasks.
- **Awareness**: These are activities that attract and engage the learner’s attention by acquainting them with aspects of an issue, concern, problem or need.

You’ll notice that none of these have an expressed or implied degree of formality, location or target audience. (Think of a newly hired senior executive with little or no exposure to the specific compliance needs your organization faces; first, someone has to get their attention and make them aware of the need to understand. The rest can follow.)
