## What are logical security controls?
---
- **Logical controls** are electronical mechanisms that limit someone's access to the system and sometimes to tangible assets and areas. This includes:
	-  Passwords
	-  Biometrics
	-  Badges/tokens readers
- This helps secure the system in the event a person has already gained physical access.

- **Discretionary Access Control** *(DAC)* - is a specific type of policy control that is enforced on all subjects and objects in an information systems. In DAC the policy specifies that every subject who has been granted access to information can do one or more from the following:
	- Pass the information
	- Grant the privileges to other subjects
	- Change security attributes on subjects, objects, information systems or components.
	- Change the rules governing access control; mandatory access controls restrict this capability
	- Rule-based access control systems are usually a form of DAC. 
- Discretionary access control systems allow **users to establish or change these permissions** on files they create or otherwise have ownership of.
- **UNIX environments** (windows, IOS, linux) have DAC system in place that creates a table that maps subjects to objects.![[Pasted image 20230912210641.png]]
- **DACs are not very scalable**; they rely on the access **control decisions made by each individual object owner**, and it can be difficult to find the source of access control issues when problems occur.

- **Mandatory Access Control**  (*MAC*) - A MAC policy is a rule that makes sure everyone follows the same security rules for the system. Only special people, called security administrators, can change the security rules. They decide what each person can do and see in the system. They also make sure that no one can do any of these things:
	-  Passing the information to unauthorized subjects or objects 
	- Granting its privileges to other subjects 
	- Changing one or more security attributes on subjects, objects, the information system or system components 
	- Choosing the security attributes to be associated with newly created or modified objects 
	- Changing the rules governing access control

- Primary difference between MAC and DAC is who can control the access. In DAC owner has full access to the file whereas in MAC only administrators can decide on object's access controls (who don't have to be owners).

**Role based access control** (*RBAC*) - users get permissions based on roles. Each role represents type of a user with identical privileges.
	- This requires high maintenance as users come and go or change from one position to another.
	- All changes should be logged.


*to understand better the MAC:*
*Mandatory access control is also determined by the owner of the assets, but on a more across-the-board basis, with little individual decision-making about who gets access.  
For example, at certain government agencies, personnel must have a certain type of security clearance to get access to certain areas. In general, this level of access is set by government policy and not by an individual giving permission based on their own judgment.  
Often this is accompanied by separation of duties, where your scope of work is limited and you do not have access to see information that does not concern you; someone else handles that information. This separation of duties is also facilitated by role-based access control, as we will discuss next.*
