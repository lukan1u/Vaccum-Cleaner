## What is a risk?
- **Risk** is the measure of object's likelihood impact by the external factors that can have negative impact on the organisation.
-  **Information security risk** has a potential negative impact as a result of unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification or destruction of the data/information systems. *Risk = Threats: Impact/Likelihood*. IT risk is also a subset of business risk.

- **Vulnerability** is a weakness gap in organization's protection. 
- **Threat** is someone/something that aims to *exploit* the weakness to gain unauthorized access.
- **Asset** is something in need of protection.
- **Impact** the magnitude(amount) of harm caused to the organisation.
- **Likelihood** of occurrence is a weighted factor based on a subjective analysis of the probability that a given threat or set of threats is capable of exploiting a given vulnerability.

## Risk management
- **Risk assessment** is defined as the process of *identifying, estimating and prioritizing* risks to an organization’s operations (including its mission, functions, image and reputation), assets, individuals, other organizations and even the nation. 
	- **Risk treatment** relates to making decisions about best actions regarding the identified and prioritized risk. The commonly used methods to deal with the risks are:
		- **Avoidance** - attempt to eliminate the risk completely by for example ceasing the operations because the magnitude and the likelihood of the risk is too great.
		- **Acceptance** - accepting the present risks as they're too unimportant or too expensive to be dealt with.
		- ***Mitigation*** - *most common* way of risk management. It involves preventive actions of likelihood of the risk or the risk impact. The preventive actions can range from policies to security controls to standards. Not all risks can be mitigated but safety measures should in place.
		- **Transfer** - Passing risk to another party. It's often *insurance policy.*
		- **Sharing** - risks can be shared to reduce their impact or likelihood.
		- *Ignoring risks is not same as acceptance of risks*

## Risk Priorities
Once the risks are identified they need to be prioritized accordingly using:
- **Qualitative risk analysis** - assigning values such a low, medium or high to determine risk priority.
- **Quantitative risk analysis** - numerical values are being used to determine both impact and likelihood based on statistical probabilities and monetarized values of loss or gain.
- **Risk Matrix** -  [[Pasted image 20230721120630.png]] is often being used to help determine risk priority.
- **Risk tolerance** - amount of risk a company is willing to accept in order to achieve desired results. *Risk threshold,  risk appetite, acceptable risk* are used synonymously.
