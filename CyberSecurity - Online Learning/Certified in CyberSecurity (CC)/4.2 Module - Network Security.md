## Types of threats
---
- **Spoofing** - attack with the goal of accessing target system with use of falsified identity.
- **Phishing** - misdirect legitimate users through malicious websites (links)
- **DOS/DDOS** - network consumption attack that prevents victim from accessing their system
- **Virus** - spreads quickly into other devices with the "help" of a user with adversary goal.
- **Worm** - spread into other devices without user consent.
- **Trojan** - often hidden in actual software is a piece of code that carries malicious behind the scenes payload that has the potential to wreak havoc on system or network. For example, ransomware often uses a Trojan to infect a target machine and then uses encryption technology to encrypt documents.
- **On-path Attack** *MITM* - place themselves between two devices (often a web browser and aÂ web server intercept or modify communications between the two
- **Side-channel** - passive attack that focuses on monitoring the target device such as power monitoring, timing and fault analysis attacks.
- **Advanced Persistent Threat** (*APT*) - high level of technical and operational sophistication over months or years. Organised by groups of attackers.
- **Insider threat** - arise from individual that are trusted by organisation. Sometimes are not willing participants
- **Malware** - program inserted to the system usually covertly with intent of compromising CIA.
- **Ransomware** - Malware used for the purpose of facilitating a ransom attack. They used cryptography on files and offer key for money to them.

- These attacks could be prevented by:
	- If device doesn't **protocol or service then it should be turned off.** It's hard to exploit something if there is no way of getting through.
	- **Firewalls** can prevent many different types of attacks. Network based firewalls protect entire network while host based firewalls protect individual systems.

## Preventing Threats
---
**In short:**
- Keep everything up to date
- Remove or disable unneeded services and protocols
- Use intrusion detection and prevention systems
- Use up to date anti-malware software
- Use firewalls


- **Antivirus** is a must in compliance with the **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard** (*PCI DSS*) - standard that applies to merchants and service providers who process credit or debit card transactions.
- **Zenmap** is a program that scans network to determine everything that is connected (Protocols).
- Firewalls is a way of isolating network segments from each other. They enforce polices by filtering network traffic based on a set of rules. It involves variety of threat management capabilities into a single framework
	-  Proxy services
	- Intrusion prevention services (IPS)
	- Identity and access management (IAM)
- Firewalls can manage traffic at Layer 2 (mac addresses,) layer 3 (IP range) and 7 layer (application programming interface (API))
