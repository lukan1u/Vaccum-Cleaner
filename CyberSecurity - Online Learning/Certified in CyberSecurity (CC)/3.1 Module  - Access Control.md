## What is Security Control
---
A control is a countermeasure designed to protect CIA triads. **Access control** limits what **object** can be available to what **subject** according to what **rules**. In basic terms the security comes down to who can access what and what they can do with it.

Access controls aren't just about restricting the access but also allowing appropriate personnel access. Access is based on three things:
1. **Subject is a user**, client, process or a program that is requesting access to an asset. Subject is also referred as **'active' because it begins the request process**.
	- device such as an endpoint, workstation, smartphone or removable storage device with onboard firmware.
	- Is active: It initiates a request for access to resources or services.
	- Requests a service from an object.
	- Should have a level of clearance (permissions) that relates to its ability to successfully access services or resources.
2. **Object is anything that subject is attempting to access**. An object is a device, process, person, user, program, server, client or other entity that responds to a request for service. Is passive since it's awaiting for subject's request.*Objects do not contain their own access control logic* therefore it's up to the owner to provide sufficient security layers.
	- Is a building, a computer, a file, a database, a printer or scanner, a server, a communications resource, a block of memory, an input/output port, a person, a software task, thread or process.
	- Is anything that provides service to a user.
	- Is passive.
	- Responds to a request.
	- May have a classification.
3. **An access rule is set of rules that allow or deny access to an object by compering the identity of a subject in access control list.** Great example of this is *firewall* which denies connection to specific networks while allowing for others to maintain good functionality.
	- Compare multiple attributes to determine appropriate access.
	- Allow access to an object.
	- Define how much access is allowed.
	- Deny access to an object.
	- Apply time-based access.

## Defence in depth
---
- **Defence in depth** - Information security strategy that uses multiple layers of protection integrating people, technology, polices to establish a barrier for missions of the organisation. It applies multiple countermeasures in a layered fashion to fulfil security objectives. Good example of this if MFA authentication or additional firewalls are being used to separate different parts of the organization's parts.
- **Layered defence strategy** - aka defence in depth, it emphasises the use of deferent controls methods to protect an asset. 

*Video key takeaway:
-  Multiple layers of defence: admin, logical/technical, physical controls
- cloud computing is not all because there is always a physical aspect to it all or real HDD/SDD somewhere in data centre.

## Principle of least privilege
---
- **The principle of least privilege** is a standard that allows minimum access necessary for users or programs to fulfil their function. 

	*A good study is that of ABC, Inc that had small IT department that has decided to save everyone's time and give everyone admin access however one user has received ransomware email that exploited the privileges of admins and encrypted all the users and files within the company. That could have been prevented if the access control was maintained properly as non admin users wouldn't have ability to change files in any way.*

- **Privileged accounts** are those with permissions beyond those of normal users, such as managers and administrators.
	- **Systems administrators**, who have the principal responsibilities for operating systems, applications deployment and performance management. 
	- **Help desk or IT support staff**, who often need to view or manipulate endpoints, servers and applications platforms by using privileged or restricted operations. 
	- **Security analysts**, who may require rapid access to the entire IT infrastructure, systems, endpoints and data environment of the organization.
	- Other classes of privileged user accounts may be created on a per-client or per-project basis

- There are several methods to avoid the abuse of the privileged accounts.
	- **Extensive and detailed logging** (collecting and storing user activities in a log). Logs then can be audited and reviewed.
	- More stringent access control than for regular users such as MFA or physical key copy etc. Basically **users with access to privileged accounts should undergo more rigorous authentication process** than the rest.
	- Deeper trust verification than regular user accounts. **Privileged account holders should be subject to more detailed background checks**, stricter nondisclosure agreements and acceptable use policies, and be willing to be subject to financial investigation.
	- More auditing than regular user accounts.

## Segregation of duties
---
- **Segregation of duties** is a practice where within an organisation some of the **processes cannot be completed by a single person** to mitigate risks and reduce insider threats. It's also known as *separation of duties*. For example a new admin request from a newly established team leader would have to be approved by head manager of the department. 
- **Two person integrity** -  is a rule in security strategy that requires a minimum of two people to be in an area together, making it impossible for a person to be in the area alone.

## Authorized Versus Unauthorized Personnel
----
After the system knows who the subjects are, it checks if they can do what they want with the objects. The system does this by looking at a security matrix that has the approved levels. For example, when someone shows an ID badge to the data center door, the system looks at the ID number and the security matrix. If the ID can open the door, the door opens. If not, the door stays locked.

## How Users Are Provisioned - account creation/modification
---
- **A new employee** - hiring manager will send the request to the security administrator to create a new user ID. This will give the user appropriate access levels. Any additional changes will have to go through company policies for elevated permissions.
- **Change of position** - If employee has been promoted their permission and access right might change. Some permissions will be elevated while others will be removed depending on user's new needs.
- **Seperation of employment** - When employees leave the company, depending on company policy and procedures, their accounts must be disabled after the termination date and time. It's good idea to first disable the account before permanently deleting it from the system.
- **It's better to have standardised roles** than copying existing user to a new role since it might give them too much access  or might be more tedious since not needed privileges will have to be manually removed. It's better to create new user based on those standardised roles.

*Video takeaway:
- A control is a way to protect data from harm. Defense-in-depth is using many technical controls together.
- Payroll needs many controls to stop money from being stolen. One control is not enough, so more controls are used.
- One technical control is to not let the same person create a new employee and print the check for them. One physical control is to lock the check paper away from the payroll person. One administrative control is to check the new employees and the check numbers regularly.
- Small and medium businesses may not have enough people to split the payroll work. They may need other ways to control payroll, like using a third party service.
