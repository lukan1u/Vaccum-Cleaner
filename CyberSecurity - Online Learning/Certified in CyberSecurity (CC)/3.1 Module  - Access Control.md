## What is Security Control
---
A control is a countermeasure designed to protect CIA triads. **Access control** limits what **object** can be available to what **subject** according to what **rules**. In basic terms the security comes down to who can access what and what they can do with it.

Access controls aren't just about restricting the access but also allowing appropriate personnel access. Access is based on three things:
1. **Subject is a user**, client, process or a program that is requesting access to an asset. Subject is also referred as **'active' because it begins the request process**.
	- device such as an endpoint, workstation, smartphone or removable storage device with onboard firmware.
	- Is active: It initiates a request for access to resources or services.
	- Requests a service from an object.
	- Should have a level of clearance (permissions) that relates to its ability to successfully access services or resources.
2. **Object is anything that subject is attempting to access**. An object is a device, process, person, user, program, server, client or other entity that responds to a request for service. Is passive since it's awaiting for subject's request.*Objects do not contain their own access control logic* therefore it's up to the owner to provide sufficient security layers.
	- Is a building, a computer, a file, a database, a printer or scanner, a server, a communications resource, a block of memory, an input/output port, a person, a software task, thread or process.
	- Is anything that provides service to a user.
	- Is passive.
	- Responds to a request.
	- May have a classification.
3. **An access rule is set of rules that allow or deny access to an object by compering the identity of a subject in access control list.** Great example of this is *firewall* which denies connection to specific networks while allowing for others to maintain good functionality.
	- Compare multiple attributes to determine appropriate access.
	- Allow access to an object.
	- Define how much access is allowed.
	- Deny access to an object.
	- Apply time-based access.
