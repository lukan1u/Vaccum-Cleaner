## What is networking
---
- **Network** is simply two or more computer linked together to share data, information or resources. Networking covers areas such as **hardware, software, protocols and encryption** to fully function.

- There are different types of network:
	- **Local Area Network** *(LAN)* - A network limited to usually a single building or floor.
	- **Wide Area Network** *(WAN)* - Long distance network that covers bigger spaces like for example  university campuses etc.
	
## Network devices
---
- **Hub** - Hubs are used to connect many devices in a network. They are not as smart as switches or routers. Also they're less likely to be used in a business.
- **Switch** - switches are wired devices that know addresses of the devices connected to them and route traffic to that port/device rather than retransmitting to all devices (better efficiency in a network). They also create separate **broadcast** (one to many internet traffic) domains when used to create **VLAN**s (despite distance the network appears to be on the same LAN network).
- **Router** - used to control traffic flow on networks. Used to connect similar networks and control traffic between them. They can be wired or wireless and can connect multiple switches. Smarter than both hubs and switches they determine the most efficient way route for traffic flow across the network.
- **Firewall** - A firewall is a network device that is used to filter traffic. It's one of the essential tools that mange, control and protect the network. It is typically deployed between a private network and the internet, but it can also be deployed between departments (segmented networks) within an organization (overall network). 
- **Server** - is a computer that provides information to other computers on the network. Some common server are: web servers, email servers, print servers, database servers and file servers. Servers are usually secured differently to protect the information they contain within.
- **Endpoint** - are the ends of the network. Usually a client or a server
- **Ethernet** (IEEE 802.3) is a standard that defines wired connections of network devices. The standard defines the way data if formatted over the wire so the devices can understand each other over the same cable.

## Device Address
---
- **Media Access Control*** *(MAC)* **address** - Every network device is assigned one of these MACs. An example is 00-13-02-1F-58-F5. The first 3 bytes of the address is manufacturer or vendor of the physical network interface (network card such as WiFi). No two devices can have the same MAC address in the same local network; otherwise an address conflict occurs. BASICALLY WHO MADE WIFI CARD
- **Internet Protocol (*IP*) Address** - IP hosts associate that address with a unique logical address. This logical IP address represents the network interface within the network and can be useful to maintain communications when a physical device is swapped with new hardware. WIFI CARD's ADDRESS assigned by ISP 
-  So mac address is the exact device while IP is the location of that exact address. For example a house can have many devices on a single network and to find that house we would use IP however to find the exact device the information must travel to we would use MAC address
	- **IPv4** - 192.168.1.1
	- **IPv6** - 2001:db8::ffff:0:1

## Networking Models
---
- There are **numerous models, architectures, and standards** available that enable the interconnection of various hardware and software systems. These models facilitate the sharing of information, coordination of activities, and accomplishment of joint or shared tasks.

- Organisation's goal is to achieve safe, reliable and effective network that will enable communication and exchange of information between people so they can get work done.
- Those goals can be re-expressed in *network terms such as OSI MODEL*:
	- Provide reliable, manged communications between hosts and users
	- Isolate functions in layers
	- Use packets as the basis of communication
	- Standardise routing, addressing and control
	- Allow layers beyond internetworking to add functionality
	- Be vendor-agnostic, scalable and resilient


- **The upper layer**, also known as the **host or application layer**, is responsible for managing the integrity of a connection and controlling the session as well as establishing, maintaining and terminating communication sessions between two computers. It is also responsible for transforming data received from the Application Layer into a format that any system can understand. And finally, it allows applications to communicate and determines whether a remote communication partner is available and accessible.
- **The lower layer** is often referred to as the **media or transport layer** and is responsible for receiving bits from the physical connection medium and converting them into a frame. Frames are grouped into standardized sizes. Think of frames as a bucket and the bits as water. If the buckets are sized similarly and the water is contained within the buckets, the data can be transported in a controlled manner. Route data is added to the frames of data to create packets. In other words, a destination address is added to the bucket. Once we have the buckets sorted and ready to go, the host layer takes over.

### Open systems Interconnection (OSI) Model
---
- The **OSI Model** was developed to create common way of **visualising communication structure for interconnected computer systems**. It is a **theoretical model** for how protocols should function. It is used to understand the communication of hardware/software and their hierarchy.
- OSI model divides network in **7 distinct layers** with the goal of **creating network communication between device**. The layers indicate how information flows through various levels of communication. Each layers communicates directly with layer above and/or below it
- The layers **5-7 are usually called the data**. However each layer can perform encapsulation.
	-  Encapsulation is the process where data gains footer or header (tailer) data by a protocol used at that layer of OSI model. It's important in layers 2-4 which generally include some sort of header. In layer 1 the data in converted into binary and send across physical wires (Ethernet cable) 
	- *In computer networks, **encapsulation** is similar to putting things in boxes. When we want to send information from one computer to another, we put the information inside different boxes at each step of the journey. Each box has its own label, just like the toy car’s box so everyone knows what's inside.
	- As data is encapsulated at each descending layer, the **previous layer’s header, payload and footer are all treated as the next layer’s payload**. The **data unit size increases as we move down** the conceptual model and the contents continue to encapsulate.
![[EDU-ELCC-70515-techart-osi_model-v01.svg]]
- To better understand the OSI Model:
	-  When someone references an image file like a JPEG or PNG, we are talking about the Presentation Layer (6). 
	- When discussing logical ports such as NetBIOS, we are discussing the Session Layer (5).
	- When discussing TCP/UDP, we are discussing the Transport Layer (4).
	- When discussing routers sending packets, we are discussing the Network Layer (3). 
	- When discussing switches, bridges or WAPs sending frames, we are discussing the Data Link Layer (2).

 - The inverse action occurs as data moves up the OSI model layers from Physical to Application. This process is known as **de-encapsulation.** he header and footer are used to properly interpret the data payload and are then discarded.

==Some terms:==
- **Payload** is the actual information
- **Footer and header** are special labels attached to payload. They are essential because they provide details about the data (such as type) and help ensure its integrity and proper delivery.

### Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)
---
- OSI model wasn't the only one to attempt to streamline networking protocols. **TCP/IP** protocol stack **focuses on the core functions** of networking. TCP/IP Protocol Architecture Layers:

	- **Application Layer** - Defines the protocols for the transport layer.
	- **Transport Layer** - Permits data to move among devices.
	- **Internet Layer** - Creates/inserts packets
	- **Network interface Layer** - How data moves through the network

- It is not just a single protocol; rather, it is a **protocol stack comprising dozens** of individual protocols. TCP/IP is a platform-independent protocol based on open standards. It was designed for ease of use rather than security.

- At the Application Layer, TCP/IP protocols include Telnet, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP), and Domain Name Service (DNS).

- The two primary Transport Layer protocols of TCP/IP are TCP and UDP. TCP is a full-duplex connection-oriented protocol, whereas UDP is a simplex connectionless protocol. In the Internet Layer, Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is used to determine the health of a network or a specific link. ICMP is utilized by ping, traceroute and other network management tools. The ping utility employs ICMP echo packets and bounces them off remote systems. Thus, you can use ping to determine whether the remote system is online, whether the remote system is responding promptly, whether the intermediary systems are supporting communications, and the level of performance efficiency at which the intermediary systems are communicating.

- `Protocols explained:`
	- **Telnet** protocol is a client-server protocol that provides access to virtual local area networks. It consists of two components: the protocol itself, which specifies how two parties communicate, and the software application that provides the service. Telnet is used to establish a connection to a Telnet server application listening on TCP port number 23 or 2323.
	-  **File transfer Protocol*** (*FTP*)  - internet protocol and a program used to transfer files between computers.
	- **Simple Mail Transport Protocol** (*SMTP*) - protocol for sending and receiving emails between senders
	- **Domain Name Service** (*DNS*) - a service, a physical server and a network protocol. As a protocol it is considered to be phone book that connects web browsers with websites. Basically it converts www.something.com into IP address 192.168.1.1
	-  **Internet Control Message Protocol** (*ICMP*) - The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is a network layer protocol used by network devices to diagnose network communication issues. It helps determine whether data is reaching its intended destination in a timely manner by using ping traceroute and other network management tools. The ping utility employs ICMP echo packets and bounces them off remote systems.![[EDU-ELCC-70520-techart-tcpip_protocol-v04.svg]]
