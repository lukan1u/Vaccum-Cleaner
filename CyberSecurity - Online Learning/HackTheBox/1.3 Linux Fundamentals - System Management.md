## Permission management
---
- **Traverse the directory** - means navigating to that directory which requires user to have **execute** permissions on the directory. Without the permission the user cannot access the directory's contents.
- **Execute permission only allows users to traverse** to the directory and view the content within that directory.
- To modify contents of the directory user needs **write** permissions to add/remove rename etc 
- Permission system on Linux is based on **octal number system** and there are three different types of permission:
	``-(r) - Read``
	``-(w) - Write``
	``-(x) - Execute``
- The permissions can be set for the `owner`, `group`, and `others` like presented in the next example with their corresponding permissions.

### Change permissions
`chmod` command is used to change permissions, permission group references:
1. **u** - owner
2. **g** -  group
3. **o** - others 
4. **a** - all

Changing `Music` permission to **write** for all:
``` This changes music foldedr to be accessable for everyone
┌──(lukas㉿pandoraBox)-[~]
└─$ chmod a-w Music/
```

We can use octal values to change the permissions as well where 1 stands for permission given and 0 for permission denied:

### Change owner
`chown` command is being used to change the owner. The syntax looks like this:
```shell-session
cry0l1t3@htb[/htb]$ chown <user>:<group> <file/directory>
```

To change `Music` folder to user
```shell-session
chown root:lukas Music/
```

Besides assigning direct user and group permissions, we can also configure special permissions for files by setting the `Set User ID` (`SUID`) and `Set Group ID` (`SGID`) bits. These `SUID`/`SGID` bits allow, for example, users to run programs with the rights of another user. Administrators often use this to give their users special rights for certain applications or files. The letter "`s`" is used instead of an "`x`". When executing such a program, the SUID/SGID of the file owner is used.
