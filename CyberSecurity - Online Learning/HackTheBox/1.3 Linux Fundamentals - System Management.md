## Permission management
---
- **Traverse the directory** - means navigating to that directory which requires user to have **execute** permissions on the directory. Without the permission the user cannot access the directory's contents.
- **Execute permission only allows users to traverse** to the directory and view the content within that directory.
- To modify contents of the directory user needs **write** permissions to add/remove rename etc 
- Permission system on Linux is based on **octal number system** and there are three different types of permission:
	``-(r) - Read``
	``-(w) - Write``
	``-(x) - Execute``
- The permissions can be set for the `owner`, `group`, and `others` like presented in the next example with their corresponding permissions.

### Change permissions
`chmod` command is used to change permissions, permission group references:
1. **u** - owner
2. **g** -  group
3. **o** - others 
4. **a** - all

Changing `Music` permission to **write** for all:
``` This changes music foldedr to be accessable for everyone
┌──(lukas㉿pandoraBox)-[~]
└─$ chmod a-w Music/
```

We can use octal values to change the permissions as well where 1 stands for permission given and 0 for permission denied:

### Change owner
`chown` command is being used to change the owner. The syntax looks like this:
```shell-session
cry0l1t3@htb[/htb]$ chown <user>:<group> <file/directory>
```

To change `Music` folder to user
```shell-session
chown root:lukas Music/
```

Besides assigning direct user and group permissions, we can also configure special permissions for files by setting the `Set User ID` (`SUID`) and `Set Group ID` (`SGID`) bits. These `SUID`/`SGID` bits allow, for example, users to run programs with the rights of another user. Administrators often use this to give their users special rights for certain applications or files. The letter "`s`" is used instead of an "`x`". When executing such a program, the SUID/SGID of the file owner is used.

Sticky Bits
When a sticky bit is set on a directory, it is represented by the letter “`t`" in the execute permission of the directory's permissions. For example, if a directory has permissions “`rwxrwxrwt`", it means that the sticky bit is set, giving the extra level of security so that no one other than the owner or root user can delete or rename the files or folders in the directory.
If the sticky bit is capitalized (`T`), then this means that all other users do not have `execute` (`x`) permissions and, therefore, cannot see the contents of the folder nor run any programs from it. The lowercase sticky bit (`t`) is the sticky bit where the `execute` (`x`) permissions have been set.

### User Management 
Commands for user commands:

| **Command**    | **Description**                                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sudo`     | Execute command as a different user.                                                                                                                       |
| `su`       | The `su` utility requests appropriate user credentials via PAM and switches to that user ID (the default user is the superuser). A shell is then executed. |
| `useradd`  | Creates a new user or update default new user information.                                                                                                 |
| `userdel`  | Deletes a user account and related files.                                                                                                                  |
| `usermod`  | Modifies a user account.                                                                                                                                   |
| `addgroup` | Adds a group to the system.                                                                                                                                |
| `delgroup` | Removes a group from the system.                                                                                                                           |
| `passwd`   | Changes user password.                                                                                                                                     |
### Package manager
The features that most package management systems provide are:

- Package downloading
- Dependency resolution
- A standard binary package format
- Common installation and configuration locations
- Additional system-related configuration and functionality
- Quality control

| **Command** | **Description** |
| ---- | ---- |
| `dpkg` | The `dpkg` is a tool to install, build, remove, and manage Debian packages. The primary and more user-friendly front-end for `dpkg` is aptitude. |
| `apt` | Apt provides a high-level command-line interface for the package management system. |
| `aptitude` | Aptitude is an alternative to apt and is a high-level interface to the package manager. |
| `snap` | Install, configure, refresh, and remove snap packages. Snaps enable the secure distribution of the latest apps and utilities for the cloud, servers, desktops, and the internet of things. |
| `gem` | Gem is the front-end to RubyGems, the standard package manager for Ruby. |
| `pip` | Pip is a Python package installer recommended for installing Python packages that are not available in the Debian archive. It can work with version control repositories (currently only Git, Mercurial, and Bazaar repositories), logs output extensively, and prevents partial installs by downloading all requirements before starting installation. |
| `git` | Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals. |
### Service and process management
The most commonly used are:

|**Signal**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`1`|`SIGHUP` - This is sent to a process when the terminal that controls it is closed.|
|`2`|`SIGINT` - Sent when a user presses `[Ctrl] + C` in the controlling terminal to interrupt a process.|
|`3`|`SIGQUIT` - Sent when a user presses `[Ctrl] + D` to quit.|
|`9`|`SIGKILL` - Immediately kill a process with no clean-up operations.|
|`15`|`SIGTERM` - Program termination.|
|`19`|`SIGSTOP` - Stop the program. It cannot be handled anymore.|
|`20`|`SIGTSTP` - Sent when a user presses `[Ctrl] + Z` to request for a service to suspend. The user can handle it afterward.|

For example, if a program were to freeze, we could force to kill it with the following command:

```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ kill 9 <PID> 
```

### Task scheduling
**Cron tool** is an automotive tools used for scheduling tasks by setting update command every now and then.

| **Time Frame**         | **Description**                                                       |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Minutes (0-59)         | This specifies in which minute the task should be executed.           |
| Hours (0-23)           | This specifies in which hour the task should be executed.             |
| Days of month (1-31)   | This specifies on which day of the month the task should be executed. |
| Months (1-12)          | This specifies in which month the task should be executed.            |
| Days of the week (0-7) | This specifies on which day of the week the task should be executed.  |

For example, such a crontab could look like this:

Code: txt

```txt
# System Update
* */6 * * /path/to/update_software.sh

# Execute scripts
0 0 1 * * /path/to/scripts/run_scripts.sh

# Cleanup DB
0 0 * * 0 /path/to/scripts/clean_database.sh

# Backups
0 0 * * 7 /path/to/scripts/backup.sh
```
