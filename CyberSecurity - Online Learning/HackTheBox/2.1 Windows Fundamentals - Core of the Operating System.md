# Core of Operating system structure
Boot directory:

|Directory|Function|
|---|---|
|Perflogs|Can hold Windows performance logs but is empty by default.|
|Program Files|On 32-bit systems, all 16-bit and 32-bit programs are installed here. On 64-bit systems, only 64-bit programs are installed here.|
|Program Files (x86)|32-bit and 16-bit programs are installed here on 64-bit editions of Windows.|
|ProgramData|This is a hidden folder that contains data that is essential for certain installed programs to run. This data is accessible by the program no matter what user is running it.|
|Users|This folder contains user profiles for each user that logs onto the system and contains the two folders Public and Default.|
|Default|This is the default user profile template for all created users. Whenever a new user is added to the system, their profile is based on the Default profile.|
|Public|This folder is intended for computer users to share files and is accessible to all users by default. This folder is shared over the network by default but requires a valid network account to access.|
|AppData|Per user application data and settings are stored in a hidden user subfolder (i.e., cliff.moore\AppData). Each of these folders contains three subfolders. The Roaming folder contains machine-independent data that should follow the user's profile, such as custom dictionaries. The Local folder is specific to the computer itself and is never synchronized across the network. LocalLow is similar to the Local folder, but it has a lower data integrity level. Therefore it can be used, for example, by a web browser set to protected or safe mode.|
|Windows|The majority of the files required for the Windows operating system are contained here.|
|System, System32, SysWOW64|Contains all DLLs required for the core features of Windows and the Windows API. The operating system searches these folders any time a program asks to load a DLL without specifying an absolute path.|
|WinSxS|The Windows Component Store contains a copy of all Windows components, updates, and service packs.|
## File system

**Pros of NTFS**
- NTFS is reliable and can restore the consistency of the file system in the event of a system failure or power loss.
- Provides security by allowing us to set granular permissions on both files and folders.
- Supports very large-sized partitions.
- Has journaling built-in, meaning that file modifications (addition, modification, deletion) are logged.

**Cons of NTFS:**

- Most mobile devices do not support NTFS natively.
- Older media devices such as TVs and digital cameras do not offer support for NTFS storage devices.

|**Permission Type** |**Description** |
|---|---|
|Full Control|Allows reading, writing, changing, deleting of files/folders.|
|Modify|Allows reading, writing, and deleting of files/folders.|
|List Folder Contents|Allows for viewing and listing folders and subfolders as well as executing files. Folders only inherit this permission.|
|Read and Execute|Allows for viewing and listing files and subfolders as well as executing files. Files and folders inherit this permission.|
|Write|Allows for adding files to folders and subfolders and writing to a file.|
|Read|Allows for viewing and listing of folders and subfolders and viewing a file's contents.|
|Traverse Folder|This allows or denies the ability to move through folders to reach other files or folders. For example, a user may not have permission to list the directory contents or view files in the documents or web apps directory in this example c:\users\bsmith\documents\webapps\backups\backup_02042020.zip but with Traverse Folder permissions applied, they can access the backup archive.|
Files and folders *inherit the NTFS permissions of their parent folder* for ease of administration, so administrators do not need to explicitly set permissions for each file and folder.

# Integrity Control Access Control List (icacls)
**To list permissions of  directory #command**
``` Lists chosen directory permissions

```

```cmd-session
c:\windows NT SERVICE\TrustedInstaller:(F)
           NT SERVICE\TrustedInstaller:(CI)(IO)(F)
           NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(M)
           NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(OI)(CI)(IO)(F)
           BUILTIN\Administrators:(M)
           BUILTIN\Administrators:(OI)(CI)(IO)(F)
           BUILTIN\Users:(RX)
           BUILTIN\Users:(OI)(CI)(IO)(GR,GE)
           CREATOR OWNER:(OI)(CI)(IO)(F)
           APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES:(RX)
           APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES:(OI)(CI)(IO)(GR,GE)
           APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL RESTRICTED APPLICATION PACKAGES:(RX)
           APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL RESTRICTED APPLICATION PACKAGES:(OI)(CI)(IO)(GR,GE)
```

**Inheritance from folders:**
- `(CI)`: container inherit
- `(OI)`: object inherit
- `(IO)`: inherit only
- `(NP)`: do not propagate inherit
- `(I)`: permission inherited from parent container
**Access to that specific folder etc**
- `F` : full access
- `D` :  delete access
- `N` :  no access
- `M` :  modify access
- `RX` :  read and execute access
- `R` :  read-only access
- `W` :  write-only access

# NTFS vs. Share Permissions
The Server Message Block protocol (**SMB**) is used in windows to connect shared resources like files and printers.
![[Pasted image 20240111184946.png]]

NTFS permissions are similar to share permissions however they are not the same.
**Share permissions:**

|Permission|Description|
|---|---|
|`Full Control`|Users are permitted to perform all actions given by Change and Read permissions as well as change permissions for NTFS files and subfolders|
|`Change`|Users are permitted to read, edit, delete and add files and subfolders|
|`Read`|Users are allowed to view file & subfolder contents|

**NTFS Basic permissions:**

|Permission|Description|
|---|---|
|`Full Control`|Users are permitted to add, edit, move, delete files & folders as well as change NTFS permissions that apply to all allowed folders|
|`Modify`|Users are permitted or denied permissions to view and modify files and folders. This includes adding or deleting files|
|`Read & Execute`|Users are permitted or denied permissions to read the contents of files and execute programs|
|`List folder contents`|Users are permitted or denied permissions to view a listing of files and subfolders|
|`Read`|Users are permitted or denied permissions to read the contents of files|
|`Write`|Users are permitted or denied permissions to write changes to a file and add new files to a folder|
|`Special Permissions`|A variety of advanced permissions options|
 
 **NTFS special permissions:**
 
|Permission|Description|
|---|---|
|`Full control`|Users are permitted or denied permissions to add, edit, move, delete files & folders as well as change NTFS permissions that apply to all permitted folders|
|`Traverse folder / execute file`|Users are permitted or denied permissions to access a subfolder within a directory structure even if the user is denied access to contents at the parent folder level. Users may also be permitted or denied permissions to execute programs|
|`List folder/read data`|Users are permitted or denied permissions to view files and folders contained in the parent folder. Users can also be permitted to open and view files|
|`Read attributes`|Users are permitted or denied permissions to view basic attributes of a file or folder. Examples of basic attributes: system, archive, read-only, and hidden|
|`Read extended attributes`|Users are permitted or denied permissions to view extended attributes of a file or folder. Attributes differ depending on the program|
|`Create files/write data`|Users are permitted or denied permissions to create files within a folder and make changes to a file|
|`Create folders/append data`|Users are permitted or denied permissions to create subfolders within a folder. Data can be added to files but pre-existing content cannot be overwritten|
|`Write attributes`|Users are permitted or denied to change file attributes. This permission does not grant access to creating files or folders|
|`Write extended attributes`|Users are permitted or denied permissions to change extended attributes on a file or folder. Attributes differ depending on the program|
|`Delete subfolders and files`|Users are permitted or denied permissions to delete subfolders and files. Parent folders will not be deleted|
|`Delete`|Users are permitted or denied permissions to delete parent folders, subfolders and files.|
|`Read permissions`|Users are permitted or denied permissions to read permissions of a folder|
|`Change permissions`|Users are permitted or denied permissions to change permissions of a file or folder|
|`Take ownership`|Users are permitted or denied permission to take ownership of a file or folder. The owner of a file has full permissions to change any permissions|

Permissions apply to the system where the folder is being stored. Also it is possible to set custom  permission on parent and subfolders if needed.

# How to create ad network share
1. Creation folder and using gui go to folder properties and navigate to share tab
2. Then to to advanced sharing and click on share this folder.

![[Pasted image 20240111190141.png]]

**ACL** access control list for specific rules and settings. Typically these ACEs are made up of `users` & `groups`
![[Pasted image 20240111190305.png]]

## Using smbclient to connect to the share and test if it works.
It is the Windows Defender Firewall that could potentially be blocking access to the SMB share. Since we are connecting from a Linux-based system the firewall has blocked access from any device that is not joined to the same `workgroup`. It is also important to note that when a Windows system is part of a workgroup, all `netlogon` requests are authenticated against that particular Windows system's `SAM` database. When a Windows system is joined to a Windows Domain environment, all netlogon requests are authenticated against `Active Directory`. The primary difference between a workgroup and a Windows Domain in terms of authentication, is with a workgroup the local SAM database is used and in a Windows Domain a centralized network-based database (Active Directory) is used. We must know this information when attempting to logon & authenticate with a Windows system. Consider where the htb-student account is hosted to properly connect to the target.

In terms of the firewall blocking connections, this can be tested by completely deactivating each firewall profile in Windows or by enabling specific predefined inbound firewall rules in the `Windows Defender Firewall advanced security settings`. Like most firewalls, Windows Defender Firewall permits or denies traffic (access & connection requests in this case) flowing `inbound` &/or `outbound`

The different inbound and outbound rules are associated with the different firewall profiles in defender.

Windows Defender Firewall Profiles:
e3
- `Public`
- `Private`
- `Domain`

It is a best practice to enable predefined rules or add custom exceptions rather than deactivating the firewall altogether. Unfortunately, it is very common for firewalls to be left completely deactivated for the sake of convenience or lack of understanding. Firewall rules on desktop systems can be centrally managed when joined to a Windows Domain environment through the use of Group Policy. Group Policy concepts and configurations are outside of the scope of this module.

Once the proper `inbound` firewall rules are enabled we will successfully connect to the share. Keep in mind that we can only connect to the share because the user account we are using (`htb-student`) is in the `Everyone group`. Recall that we left the specific share permissions for the Everyone group set to Read, which quite literally means we will only be able to Read files on this share. Once a connection is established with a share, we can create a `mount point` from our Pwnbox to the Windows 10 target box's file system. This is where we must also consider that NTFS permissions apply alongside share permissions. Recall that NTFS is the default file system in Windows. Lets jump back to our xfreerdp session with our Windows 10 target box and take a look at the NTFS permissions on the Company Data folder.

*Any device trying to access SMB share that is not part of the same workgroup will be blocked by windows firewall. In the setting for the firewall you will have to add inbound `tcp port 445` that is used by SMB protocol. Otherwise you will not be able to connect. #protocol*

**Connecting Share smbclient #command**
```shell-session
[!bash!]$ smbclient -L IPaddressOfTarget -U htb-student
```

**Installing CIFS Utilities #command** 

```shell-session
[!bash!]$ sudo apt-get install cifs-utils
```

**Mounting to the share #command**
```shell-session
sudo mount -t cifs -o username=htb-student,password=Academy_WinFun! //ipaddoftarget/"Company Data" /home/user/Desktop/
```

`net share` is a useful command to check all shared folder on windows system. Computer management software can be used to check the same info #command 
```cmd-session
C:\Users\htb-student> net share

Share name   Resource                        Remark

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C$           C:\                             Default share
IPC$                                         Remote IPC
ADMIN$       C:\WINDOWS                      Remote Admin
Company Data C:\Users\htb-student\Desktop\Company Data
```

 **Viewing Share access logs in Event Viewer**
- Event viewer is an excellent logging software. It can shows all the logins and attempted connection to the shared folder.

# Working with services and processes
---

## Windows Services

Windows services are managed via **Service Control Manager** (SCM) accessible via the `services.msc` MMC add-in.

**Displays first 2 services running #command**:

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Get-Service | ? {$_.Status -eq "Running"} | select -First 2 |fl
```

There 2 states the services can be:
- Running
- Sopped
  There are 3 catogories:
  - Local Services
  - Network Services
  - System services

Windows has also `critical system services` that cannot be stopped without system restart. If any of these files is updated it will require system reset.

| Service | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| smss.exe | Session Manager SubSystem. Responsible for handling sessions on the system. |
| csrss.exe | Client Server Runtime Process. The user-mode portion of the Windows subsystem. |
| wininit.exe | Starts the Wininit file .ini file that lists all of the changes to be made to Windows when the computer is restarted after installing a program. |
| logonui.exe | Used for facilitating user login into a PC |
| lsass.exe | The Local Security Authentication Server verifies the validity of user logons to a PC or server. It generates the process responsible for authenticating users for the Winlogon service. |
| services.exe | Manages the operation of starting and stopping services. |
| winlogon.exe | Responsible for handling the secure attention sequence, loading a user profile on logon, and locking the computer when a screensaver is running. |
| System | A background system process that runs the Windows kernel. |
| svchost.exe with RPCSS | Manages system services that run from dynamic-link libraries (files with the extension .dll) such as "Automatic Updates," "Windows Firewall," and "Plug and Play." Uses the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Service (RPCSS). |
| svchost.exe with Dcom/PnP | Manages system services that run from dynamic-link libraries (files with the extension .dll) such as "Automatic Updates," "Windows Firewall," and "Plug and Play." Uses the Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) and Plug and Play (PnP) services. |
| Wiki | [List of all the MS windows components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Microsoft_Windows_components#Services) |
## Processes
Run in the background of Windows system. They don't have to be part of the OS and can be started by other applications. Some of the are critical and they shouldn't be stopped. These include:
- Windows Logon Application 
- System
- System Idle Process
- Windows Start-Up Application
- Client Server Runtime
- Windows Session Manager
- Service Host
- Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process

## Local Security Authority Subsystem (LSASS)

- `lsass.exe` is the process responsible for security policy on Windows systems. When user attempts to login to the system, this process verifies their login details and create access token based on permission levels of a user.
- Produces Windows Security Logs
- Also manages password changes
- HIGHLY TARGETED to extract data from.

## SysInternal Tools

The SysInternals Tools suite are portable Windows applications that can be used to administer Windows system without installation for the most part. SysInternal tools installation Location in Windows File Explorer:

`\\live.sysinternals.com\tools` network storage #command 

The suite includes tools such as `Process Explorer`, an enhanced version of `Task Manager`, and `Process Monitor`, which can be used to monitor file system, registry, and network activity related to any process running on the system.

## Task Manager
| Tab | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| Processes tab | Shows a list of running applications and background processes along with the CPU, memory, disk, network, and power usage for each. |
| Performance tab | Shows graphs and data such as CPU utilization, system uptime, memory usage, disk and, networking, and GPU usage. We can also open the `Resource Monitor`, which gives us a much more in-depth view of the current CPU, Memory, Disk, and Network resource usage. |
| App history tab | Shows resource usage for the current user account for each application for a period of time. |
| Startup tab | Shows which applications are configured to start at boot as well as the impact on the startup process. |
| Users tab | Shows logged in users and the processes/resource usage associated with their session. |
| Details tab | Shows the name, process ID (PID), status, associated username, CPU, and memory usage for each running application. |
| Services tab | Shows the name, PID, description, and status of each installed service. The Services add-in can be accessed from this tab as well. |
## Process Explorer

Process Explorer is a part of the SysInternals tool suite. This tool can show which handles and DLL processes are loaded when a program runs. Process Explorer shows a list of currently running processes, and from there, we can see what handles the process has selected in one view or the DLLs and memory-swapped files that have been loaded in another view. he tool can also be used to analyse parent-child process relationships to see what child processes are spawned by an application

# Service Permissions
---

- \Windows services are vital for long-running processes therefore they are often targeted in cyber attacks.
- Critical network services like DHCP and Active Directory Domain services are installed using admin account. Therefore it's essential for a company to have service accounts as those services are assigned with that specific user and can be run through that user. 
- Services permissions and the permissions of the directories they execute from are vital in the system protection.

## Examining Services using services.msc

`services.msc` manage everything with all services. #command 

![[Pasted image 20240113165613.png]]

- If the **directory of a service is configured with weak permission**, an attacker could use it to replace the original exe with ones used for malicious purposes. 
- Most services run with **Local System privileges** which is the highest level access allowed on the individual Windows OS. Not all applications installed by a user need that and we always should adhere to **principle of least privilege**. 
- Service accounts in Windows are but also new users can be added with the sole purpose of running a service:
	- **LocalService**
	- **NetworkService**
	- **LocalSystem**
- Recovery for these services should be also configured properly
![[Pasted image 20240113170852.png]]


## Examining services using sc
`sc qc` is a command used to query the service.

**Display information about the service** #command 
```cmd-session
sc qc wuauserv
```

**Display information about the service whilst being on the network** #command 
```cmd-session
sc //hostname or ip of box query ServiceName
```

**Start/ Stop of a service** #command 
```cmd-session
sc stop wuauserv
```

**Examining service permissions** #command 
```cmd-session
sc sdshow wuauserv
```
Every named object is a securable object and some unnamed objects are securable. Every securable object has security descriptor. Security descriptor identify the object's owner and a primary group containing a Discretionary Access Control List (DACL) and System Acces (SACL)
