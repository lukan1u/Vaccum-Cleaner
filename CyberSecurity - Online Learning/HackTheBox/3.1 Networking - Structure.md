**Topologies** - Mesh, tree, star
**Medium** - ethernet, fiber, coax, wireless
**Protocols** - TCP, UDP, IPX

On a network computer can talk to each other as long as `192.168.1.xxx` is the same except the xxx with /24 as default subnet mask.
Adding subnet mask `/25` will divide network where devices with that subnet will be able to communicate with each other but not anything else.

The difference between `URL`s and `FQDN`s is that:
- an `FQDN` (`www.hackthebox.eu`) only specifies the address of the "building" and
- an `URL` (`https://www.hackthebox.eu/example?floor=2&office=dev&employee=17`) also specifies the "`floor`," "`office`," "`mailbox`" and the corresponding "`employee`" for whom the package is intended.

We do not know the exact geographical location of the address but here is why we need ISP because in this scenario they would be like a post office that has all information needed to reach the correct address. Router communicates with ISP and ISP communicates with other networks.

As soon as we send our packet through our post office (`router`), the packet is forwarded to the `main post office` (`ISP`). This main post office looks in the `address register`/`phonebook` (`Domain Name Service`) where this address is located and returns the corresponding geographical coordinates (`IP address`). Now that we know the address's exact location, our packet is sent directly there by a direct flight via our main post office.

1. The Web Server should be in a DMZ (Demilitarized Zone). It should be placed in separate network because clients and directly communicate with the server which can be compromised.
2. Workstations should be on their own network and each workstation should have a Host Based Firewall rule preventing it from talking to other workstations.
3. The Switch and Router should be on an "Administration Network" This prevents workstations from snooping in on any communications between these devices.
4. IP Phones should be on their own network. Security- wise this is to prevent computers from being able to eavesdrop on communication.
5. Printers should be on their own network.

# Network types

|**Network Type**|**Definition**|
|---|---|
|Wide Area Network (WAN)|Internet|
|Local Area Network (LAN)|Internal Networks (Ex: Home or Office)|
|Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)|Internal Networks accessible over Wi-Fi|
|Virtual Private Network (VPN)|Connects multiple network sites to one `LAN`|
**WAN** - is usually refereed as the Internet. WAN is the address  with large number of LANs joined together. Many governments or large companies will have an "Internal WAN" (also called Intranet Airgap Network). To identify WAN is to use WAN specific routing protocols such as BGP and if the IP Schema is in use is not within RFC 1918.

**LAN / WLAN** - there is not much difference between LAN or WLAN. Both use RFC 1918 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16. WLAN doesn't needs cables.

**VPN** - making user feel as if they were plugged into a different network.
- **Site-To-Site VPN** -Client and server are network devices typically either Routers or Firewalls, and share entire network ranges. This is most commonly used to join company networks together over the internet.
- **Remote Access VPN** - Creating a virtual interface that behaves as if it is on a client's network. When analysing these VPNs it's important to consider routing table that is created when joining the VPN. If the VPN creates routes for specific networks (for example 10.10.10.0/24) this is called a `Split-Tunnel VPN` meaning the connection is not going out of the VPN. It's good for HTB because there is no concern of monitoring however companies may not like it because infected machines cannot be scanned for malware.
- **SSL VPN** - This is essentially a VPN that is done within our web browser and is becoming increasingly common as web browsers are becoming capable of doing anything. Typically these will stream applications or entire desktop sessions to your web browser. A great example of this would be the HackTheBox Pwnbox.

|Network Type|Definition|
|---|---|
|Global Area Network (GAN)|Global network (the Internet)|
|Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)|Regional network (multiple LANs)|
|Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN)|Personal network (Bluetooth)|

**GAN** - A worldwide network such as the Internet. Internationally active companies also maintain isolated networks that span several WANs and connect company computers worldwide. GANs use the glass fibres infrastructure of wide area networks and interconnect them by international undersea cables or satellite transmission.

**MAN** - Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) - is a broadband telecommunications network that connects several LANs in geographical proximity. These are individual branches of a company connected to a MAN via leased lines. High-performance routers and high-performance connections based on glass fibbers are used. Internationally operating network operatos provide the infrastructure for MANs. Cities wired as `Metropolitan Area Networks` can be integrated supra-regionally in `Wide Area Networks` (`WAN`) and internationally in `Global Area Networks` (`GAN`).

**PAN / WPAN** - Modern end devices such as smartphones can be connected ad hoc to form a network to enable data exchange. These can be done via the cable. WPAN is wireless version of that and a good example is Bluetooth and it is also called Piconet. These networks are usually short distance. Protocols such as Insteon, Z-Wave, and ZigBee were explicitly designed for smart homes and home automation.

# Network Topologies
---
It's arrangement of **physical and logical** connection of devices in a network. Computers are hosts, such as clients and servers. It's also in combination with switches, bridges and routers so that the network can function.

**Transmission medium layout** is used to connect devices in the physical topology of the network.
It's a cabling plan of the position of the nodes and cables in-between those nodes.
**Logical topology** refers to how singles act on the network and how data will be transmitted from one device to another across the whole physical network.

**Connections**:

|`Wired connections`|`Wireless connections`|
|---|---|
|Coaxial cabling|Wi-Fi|
|Glass fiber cabling|Cellular|
|Twisted-pair cabling|Satellite|
|and others|and others|

**Firewalls** - Network Interface Controller (NICs): 

| Repeaters | Hubs | Bridges | Switches |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Router/Modem | Gateways | Firewalls |  |
**Network topologies**:
- **Point to point** - direct connection of two devices. They're not P2P (peer to peer architecture)![[Pasted image 20240202181907.png]]
- **Star** - Each device is connected to central network component via a separate link. This is usually a router, hub or a switch. These handle  forwarding function for the data packets. The data traffic is high  because all data and connections go through central network component.![[Pasted image 20240202182109.png]]
- **Mesh** - Many nodes decide about connections on a physical level and the routing on a logical level. Meshed structures have no fixed topology. Each host is connected to every other host in the network in a **fully meshed structure**. This is used in WAN or MAN to ensure high reliability and bandwidth. If router fails there is always another one to replace it. Each node on fully meshed structure  has the same routing functions and knows the neighbouring nodes it can communicate with proximity to the network gateway and traffic loads. In **partially meshed structure** the endpoints are connected by only one connection.![[Pasted image 20240202183746.png]]
- **Hybrid** - Hybrid networks combine two or more topologies so that the resulting network does not present any standard topologies.  A hybrid topology is always created when `two different` basic network topologies are interconnected.
![[Pasted image 20240202184044.png]]

- **Bus** - Every host has access to the transmission medium. There is no central network component that controls the processes on it.  On bus network only one host can send and all the others can only receive and check  data is intended for them ![[Pasted image 20240202181856.png]]
- **Ring** - each host or node has connection coming to and from the device. It does not require active network component. The control and access to the transmission medium are regulated by a protocol to which all stations adhere. Also it is using a token which is a bit pattern that continually passes through a ring network in one direction which works according to the claim token process.![[Pasted image 20240202182723.png]]
- **Tree** - extended star topology that more extensive local network have in this structure. This is useful when several topologies are combined. There are both logical tree structures according to the `spanning tree` and physical ones. Tree topologies are also used for `broadband networks` and `city networks` (`MAN`).
![[Pasted image 20240202183958.png]]


- **Daisy Chain**- In the daisy chain topology, multiple hosts are connected by placing a cable from one node to another. Since this creates a chain of connections, it is also known as a daisy-chain configuration in which multiple hardware components are connected in a series. This type of networking is often found in automation technology (`CAN`).![[Pasted image 20240202184135.png]]

# Proxies
---
It's a device or service that sits in the middle of connection and acts as a mediator. It inspects the contents of the traffic. Without the mediator usually a device is a gateway not a proxy.

Key proxies:
- `Dedicated Proxy` / `Forward Proxy`
- `Reverse Proxy`
- `Transparent Proxy`

**Dedicated Proxy / Forward Proxy** - is when a client makes a request to a computer and that computer carries out the request to a server etc. For example corporate networks may have sensitive information therefore to access the website the requests must go through a proxy such as web filter to access that websites to maintain security.
