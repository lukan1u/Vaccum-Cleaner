This command helps with getting manual (detailed explanation) pages about any Linux tools available:
```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ man curl
```

Explains features of the tool:
```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ <tool> --help
```

Each manual page has short description:
```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ apropos <keyword>
```

## Navigation

If we type command `ls- l` it will display additional information about the directories and files.
`total [x]` means how much total storage size is being used. Basically this data is not the content but the information needed for the system to etc know where the folder is stored. **1 = 512bytes**

|**Column Content**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`drwxr-xr-x`|Type and permissions|
|`2`|Number of hard links to the file/directory|
|`cry0l1t3`|Owner of the file/directory|
|`htbacademy`|Group owner of the file/directory|
|`4096`|Size of the file or the number of blocks used to store the directory information|
|`Nov 13 17:37`|Date and time|
|`Desktop`|Directory name|

Switch between directories
```shell-session
cry0l1t3@htb[/dev/shm]$ cd -
```

Double `TAB` when `cd` -  gives you options to which directory you can go to. It's a shortcut so if you press s it will list all directories starting with letter s
