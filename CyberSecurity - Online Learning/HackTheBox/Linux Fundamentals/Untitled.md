| `Everything is a file`                                        | All configuration files for the various services running on the Linux operating system are stored in one or more text files.                                   |
| `Small, single-purpose programs`                              | Linux offers many different tools that we will work with, which can be combined to work together.                                                              |
| `Ability to chain programs together to perform complex tasks` | The integration and combination of different tools enable us to carry out many large and complex tasks, such as processing or filtering specific data results. |
| `Avoid captive user interfaces`                               | Linux is designed to work mainly with the shell (or terminal), which gives the user greater control over the operating system.                                 |
| `Configuration data stored in a text file`                    | An example of such a file is the `/etc/passwd` file, which stores all users registered on the system.                                                          |
