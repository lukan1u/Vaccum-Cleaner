Quick Summary: Linux is highly customizable and everything is a file. It's organised in a way it's obvious for a user  to use it. Very basic system makes it reliable. Shell is the ultimate way of managing the OS as it directly communicates between user and kernel. Kernel directly communicates with the hardware and I/O devices.

# Philosophy
---
- **Everything is a file** - All files can be manually configured and are stored in text files
- **Small, single-purpose programs** - Linux offers many different tools with single purpose but they can be combined to work together.
- **Ability to chain progress together to perform complex tasks** - integration of many tools enable Linux users carrying complex tasks such as processing or filtering specific data results.
- **Avoid captive user interfaces** - Linux was created to mainly work in shell which gives user greater control over the OS.
- **Configuration data stored in a text file** - an example is the /etc/passwd files which stores all registered users 

## Components
---
- **Bootloader** -  is a piece of code that guides booting process to start OS.
- **OS Kernel** - main component of the OS. It manages system resouces and I/O device
- **Daemons** - background programs that usually start after booting. They are responsible for key functions of operating systems such as printing or multimedia and whether they work correctly.
- **OS Shell** - it's the terminal (cmd) or also known as user interface that is between os and the user.
- **Graphics server** - it's graphical sub-system (server) called "x" that allows graphical programs to run locally or remotely on the X-windowing system.
- **Windows manager** - GUI or desktop environment
- **Utilities** - specific programs in the OS that help manage it.

## Linux Architecture
----
- The Linux OS can be broken down into layers:
	- **Hardware** - all devices such as CPU, RAM, SDD.
	- **Kernel** - Manages all the computer hardware and it functions by virtualising and controlling all of the hardware and prevents conflicts between processes.
	- **Shell** - CLI user uses it to enter commands and to execuate the kernel's functions.
	- **System Utility** - makes available to the user all of the operating system's functionality.

## File system Hierarchy
---
- `/` - The top-level directory is the root filesystem and contains all of the files required to boot the operating system before other filesystems are mounted as well as the files required to boot the other filesystems. After boot, all of the other filesystems are mounted at standard mount points as subdirectories of the root.
- `/bin` - Contains essential command binaries.
- `/boot`- Consists of the static bootloader, kernel executable, and files required to boot the Linux OS.
- `/dev`- Contains device files to facilitate access to every hardware device attached to the system.
- `/etc` - Local system configuration files. Configuration files for installed applications may be saved here as well.
- `/home`- Each user on the system has a subdirectory here for storage.
- `/lib`- Shared library files that are required for system boot.
- `/media`- External removable media devices such as USB drives are mounted here.
- `/mnt`- Temporary mount point for regular filesystems.
- `/opt`- Optional files such as third-party tools can be saved here.
- `/root`- The home directory for the root user.
- `/sbin`- This directory contains executables used for system administration (binary system files).
- `/tmp`- The operating system and many programs use this directory to store temporary files. This directory is generally cleared upon system boot and may be deleted at other times without any warning.
- `/usr` - Contains executables, libraries, man files, etc.
- `/var` - This directory contains variable data files such as log files, email in-boxes, web application related files, cron files, and more.

## Linux Distributions
---
- **Linux distributions** are used for various purposed such as servers, embedded devices or desktop computer even mobile phones. **The kernel is always the same** but they come with different sets of features and modifications.
-  For our cybersecurity needs Linux is ideal workspace because it allows high amount of customisation so we can tailor it to our needs.
- The package management system helps keep the system up-to-date and secure by automatically downloading and installing security updates as soon as they are available.

## Introduction to shells
---
- A Linux **terminal also called a shell** or command line provides a **text-based I/O** between user and kernel for a computer system.
- We think of shell as a **text-based GUI** where we work with files and obtain any infromation as well as performing some tasks.

## Terminal Emulators
---
- Terminal emulators is a software that **emulates the function of a terminal**. By doing so it can enhance the experience by having additional features and integrate GUI components into its feature set. Usually terminal emulators are often called (*CLI*) command-line interface. Terminal server as an interface to the shell interpreter.
- **Terminal emulators are multiplexers** because they provide us with different functions such as splitting the terminal and working in multiple directories.

	- Example of terminal emulator:![[Pasted image 20230920203158.png]]
- The most common shell in Linux is **BASH Bourne-Again Shell** and is part of the GNU project. Everything we do through the GUI we can do with the shell. It gives us more possibilities. Also some processes can be automated with simple scripts.
