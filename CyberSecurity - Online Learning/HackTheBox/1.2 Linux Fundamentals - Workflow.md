## Copy move and create
---
We can use `touch` to create an empty file and `mkdir` to create a directory.

**Go to home directory**:
```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ cd ~
```
**Create**:
```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ touch <name>
```
**Make new repository**:
```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ mkdir <name>
```
**Add folder to new directory**:
```shell-session
mkdir -p Storage/local/user/documents
```
**Rename/Move  file/directory (they share command)**
```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ mv <file/directory> <renamed file/directory>
```
```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ mv information.txt readme.txt Storage/
```
**Copy:**
```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ cp Storage/readme.txt Storage/local/
```

# Editing files
---
One of the most common text editors for this is `Vi` and `Vim` there is also a `nano`
**To learn about vim:**
```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ vimtutor
```

**View contents of the file:**
```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ cat notes.txt
```
## Find files and directories
---
**which:**
One of the common tools is `which`. This tool returns the path to the file or link that should be executed. This allows us to **determine if specific programs** like python, gcc, **are available on the operating system.**
```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ which python
```
**find**:
Another handy tool is `find`. Besides the function to find files and folders, this tool also contains the function to filter the results
```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ find <location> <options>
```

| Option                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `-type f`             | Hereby, we define the type of the searched object. In this case, '`f`' stands for '`file`'.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `-name *.conf`        | With '`-name`', we indicate the name of the file we are looking for. The asterisk (`*`) stands for 'all' files with the '`.conf`' extension.                                                                                                                                   |
| `-user root`          | This option filters all files whose owner is the root user.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `-size +20k`          | We can then filter all the located files and specify that we only want to see the files that are larger than 20 KiB.                                                                                                                                                           |
| `-newermt 2020-03-03` | With this option, we set the date. Only files newer than the specified date will be presented.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `-exec ls -al {} \;`  | This option executes the specified command, using the curly brackets as placeholders for each result. The backslash escapes the next character from being interpreted by the shell because otherwise, the semicolon would terminate the command and not reach the redirection. |
| `2>/dev/null`         | This is a `STDERR` redirection to the '`null device`', which we will come back to in the next section. This redirection ensures that no errors are displayed in the terminal. This redirection must `not` be an option of the 'find' command.                                  |

**Locate**:
It will take too much time to search through whole system. Locate uses a local database that contains all information about existing files and folders. The database can be updates using command like this:
```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ sudo updatedb
```
For example if we wanted to locate all file with `.conf` extension we would run command like this:
```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ locate *.conf
```
However, this tool does not have as many filter options that we can use. So it is always worth considering whether we can use the `locate` command or instead use the `find` command. It always depends on what we are looking for.

## File descriptors and redirections
---
A **file descriptor** (FD) in Unix operating systems is an indicator of connection maintained by the kernel to perform I/O operations. In windows it's called file handle.
It is the connection (generally to a file) from the OS to perform I/O operations.

By default there are three file descriptors in Linux:
- `STDIN - 0` for input
- `STDOUT - 1` for output
- `STDERR - 2` - for error related output

#### STDIN and STDOUT and STDERR
**Basically files are I/O** in concept because we humans use them to write changes and get some kind of output. In the example with `cat` we can see that if we write "something" it will give us "something" back.
![[Pasted image 20231022181123.png]]

We can get another output type which is the error `STDERR`. It is system or program related for us to understand why something cannot be done.
![[Pasted image 20231022181446.png]]
In this case, the error is marked and displayed with "`Permission denied`" We can redirect the error messages and get only STDOUT by for example running command like this:
```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ find /etc/ -name shadow 2>/dev/null
```


We can also redirect the `STDOUT` as well to for example a **text based** file (basically create a file will all of the output.
```shell-session
find /etc/ -name shadow 2>/dev/null > results.txt
```

We can also separate those different outputs to different files if wished like so:
```shell-session
find /etc/ -name shadow 2> stderr.txt 1> stdout.txt
```

We can also work with `<` to write changes or override them however if we wish to append changes we can use `<<` like so :
```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ find /etc/ -name passwd >> stdout.txt 2>/dev/null
```

#### Pipes
- Another way to redirect `STDOUT` is to use pipes (`|`). These are useful when we want to use the `STDOUT` from one program to be processed by another.
- Grep is used to filter `STDOUT` according to the pattern we define.
![[Pasted image 20231023201757.png]]
we use the `find` command to search for all files in the "`/etc/`" directory with a "`.conf`" extension. Any errors are redirected to the "`null device`" (`/dev/null`). Using `grep`, we filter out the results and specify that only the lines containing the pattern "`systemd`" should be displayed. we will use the tool called `wc`, which should count the total number of obtained results.
```shell-session
find /etc/ -name *.conf 2>/dev/null | grep systemd | wc -l
```



*HTB Solutions:*
Find a number of `.log` files:
``` 
find  / -type f -name * .log | wc
```
Find total number of packages installed on the system:
```
dpkg -l | grep -c '^ii'
```

## Filter contents
---
| Command  | Description                                                                                                                        |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `more`   | is a pager which reads contents in interactive way. Output remains in the terminal                                                 |
| `less`   | is another pages with more features than `more`. The presentation is the same however the outputs does not remain in the terminal. |
| `head`   | prints only first ten lines of output unless specified otherwise                                                                   |
| `tail`   | prints last ten lines of a file                                                                                                    |
| `sort`   | is used to sort through files alphabetically or numerically                                                                        |
| `grep`   | will only search for specific results that contain patterns we have defined. `-v` is used to to exclude specific results           |
| `cut`    | It removes specific delimiters. we can use `-d":"` to remove colons and use `f` to define option in the line we want to output     |
| `tr`     | can replace characters   similar to cut                                                                                            |
| `column` | is used to represents data in more structured way                                                                                  |
| `awk`    | helps sort out results which allows us to display the first (`$1`) and last (`$NF`) result of the line                             |
| `sed`    | modifies output using patterns                                                                                                     |
| `wc`     | counts the outputs for us. `-l` counts the lines |


```shell-session
more /etc/passwd 
less /etc/passwd
head /etc/passwd
tail /etc/passwd
cat /etc/passwd | sort
cat /etc/passwd | grep "/bin/bash"
cat /etc/passwd | grep -v "false\|nologin"
cat /etc/passwd | grep -v "false\|nologin" | cut -d":" -f1
cat /etc/passwd | grep -v "false\|nologin" | tr ":" " "
cat /etc/passwd | grep -v "false\|nologin" | tr ":" " " | column -t
cat /etc/passwd | grep -v "false\|nologin" | tr ":" " " | awk '{print $1, $NF}'
cat /etc/passwd | grep -v "false\|nologin" | tr ":" " " | awk '{print $1, $NF}' | sed 's/bin/HTB/g'
```

*Hack the box questions:*
- How many services are listening on the target system on all interfaces? (not on localhost and ipv4 only):
```
netstat -ln4 | grep LISTEN | grep -v 127 | wc -l
```
- Determine what user the ProFTPd server is running under. Submit the username as the answer.
```
ps aux | grep proftpd
```
- Use cURL from your Pwnbox (not the target machine) to obtain the source code of the "https://www.inlanefreight.com" website and filter all unique paths of that domain. Submit the number of these paths as the answer.
```
curl https://www.inlanefreight.com/ | grep -Eo "https:\/\/.{0,3}\.inlanefreight\.com[^\"\']*" | sort -u | wc -l
```

## Regular expressions
---
**RedEx** is an expression language to search for patterns in text and files. They can be used to replace text, analyse data, validate input, perform searches, and more. In simple terms it's a **filter**.

|     | **Operators** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                             |
| --- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | `(a)`         | The round brackets are used to group parts of a regex. Within the brackets, you can define further patterns which should be processed together.                             |
| 2   | `[a-z]`       | The square brackets are used to define character classes. Inside the brackets, you can specify a list of characters to search for.                                          |
| 3   | `{1,10}`      | The curly brackets are used to define quantifiers. Inside the brackets, you can specify a number or a range that indicates how often a previous pattern should be repeated. |
| 4   | `\|`          | Also called the OR operator and shows results when one of the two expressions matches                                                                                       |
| 5   | `.*`          | Also called the AND operator and displayed results only if both expressions match                                                                                           |
|     |               |                                                                                                                                                                             |

*OR* operator:
```shell-session
cry0l1t3@htb:~$ grep -E "(my|false)" /etc/passwd

lxd:x:105:65534::/var/lib/lxd/:/bin/false
pollinate:x:109:1::/var/cache/pollinate:/bin/false
mysql:x:116:120:MySQL Server,,:/nonexistent:/bin/false
```

*AND* operator
```shell-session
cry0l1t3@htb:~$ grep -E "(my.*false)" /etc/passwd

mysql:x:116:120:MySQL Server,,:/nonexistent:/bin/false
```
