## Copy move and create
---
We can use `touch` to create an empty file and `mkdir` to create a directory.

**Go to home directory**:
```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ cd ~
```
**Create**:
```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ touch <name>
```
**Make new repository**:
```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ mkdir <name>
```
**Add folder to new directory**:
```shell-session
mkdir -p Storage/local/user/documents
```
**Move file/directory:**
```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ mv <file/directory> <renamed file/directory>
```
