This command helps with getting manual (detailed explanation) pages about any Linux tools available:
```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ man curl
```

Explains features of the tool:
```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ <tool> --help
```

Each manual page has short description:
```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ apropos <keyword>
```

## Navigation
---
If we type command `ls- l` it will display additional information about the directories and files.
`total [x]` means how much total storage size is being used. Basically this data is not the content but the information needed for the system to etc know where the folder is stored. **1 = 512bytes**

|**Column Content**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`drwxr-xr-x`|Type and permissions|
|`2`|Number of hard links to the file/directory|
|`cry0l1t3`|Owner of the file/directory|
|`htbacademy`|Group owner of the file/directory|
|`4096`|Size of the file or the number of blocks used to store the directory information|
|`Nov 13 17:37`|Date and time|
|`Desktop`|Directory name|

Switch between directories
```shell-session
cry0l1t3@htb[/dev/shm]$ cd -
```

Double `TAB` when `cd` -  gives you options to which directory you can go to. It's a shortcut so if you press s it will list all directories starting with letter s

- `.` represents **current** directory
- `..` represents **previous** directory

`[Ctrl] + [R]` helps search through command history.

## Copy move and create
---
We can use `touch` to create an empty file and `mkdir` to create a directory.

**Go to home directory**:
```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ cd ~
```
**Create**:
```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ touch <name>
```
**Make new repository**:
```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ mkdir <name>
```
**Add folder to new directory**:
```shell-session
mkdir -p Storage/local/user/documents
```
**Rename/Move  file/directory (they share command)**
```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ mv <file/directory> <renamed file/directory>
```
```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ mv information.txt readme.txt Storage/
```
**Copy:**
```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ cp Storage/readme.txt Storage/locale

# Editing files
---
One of the most common text editors for this is `Vi` and `Vim` there is also a `nano`
**To learn about vim:**
```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ vimtutor
```

**View contents of the file:**
```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ cat notes.txt
```
## Find files and directories
---
**which:**
One of the common tools is `which`. This tool returns the path to the file or link that should be executed. This allows us to **determine if specific programs** like python, gcc, **are available on the operating system.**
```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ which python
```
**find**:
Another handy tool is `find`. Besides the function to find files and folders, this tool also contains the function to filter the results
```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ find <location> <options>
```

| Option                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `-type f`             | Hereby, we define the type of the searched object. In this case, '`f`' stands for '`file`'.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `-name *.conf`        | With '`-name`', we indicate the name of the file we are looking for. The asterisk (`*`) stands for 'all' files with the '`.conf`' extension.                                                                                                                                   |
| `-user root`          | This option filters all files whose owner is the root user.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `-size +20k`          | We can then filter all the located files and specify that we only want to see the files that are larger than 20 KiB.                                                                                                                                                           |
| `-newermt 2020-03-03` | With this option, we set the date. Only files newer than the specified date will be presented.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `-exec ls -al {} \;`  | This option executes the specified command, using the curly brackets as placeholders for each result. The backslash escapes the next character from being interpreted by the shell because otherwise, the semicolon would terminate the command and not reach the redirection. |
| `2>/dev/null`         | This is a `STDERR` redirection to the '`null device`', which we will come back to in the next section. This redirection ensures that no errors are displayed in the terminal. This redirection must `not` be an option of the 'find' command.                                  |

**Locate**:
It will take too much time to search through whole system. Locate uses a local database that contains all information about existing files and folders. The database can be updates using command like this:
```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ sudo updatedb
```
For example if we wanted to locate all file with `.conf` extension we would run command like this:
```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ locate *.conf
```
However, this tool does not have as many filter options that we can use. So it is always worth considering whether we can use the `locate` command or instead use the `find` command. It always depends on what we are looking for.

## File descriptors and redirections
---
A **file descriptor** (FD) in Unix operating systems is an indicator of connection maintained by the kernel to perform I/O operations. In windows it's called file handle.
It is the connection (generally to a file) from the OS to perform I/O operations.

By default there are three file descriptors in Linux:
- `STDIN - 0` for input
- `STDOUT - 1` for output
- `STDERR - 2` - for error related output

#### STDIN and STDOUT and STDERR
**Basically files are I/O** in concept because we humans use them to write changes and get some kind of output. In the example with `cat` we can see that if we write "something" it will give us "something" back.
![[Pasted image 20231022181123.png]]

We can get another output type which is the error `STDERR`. It is system or program related for us to understand why something cannot be done.
![[Pasted image 20231022181446.png]]
In this case, the error is marked and displayed with "`Permission denied`" We can redirect the error messages and get only STDOUT by for example running command like this:
```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ find /etc/ -name shadow 2>/dev/null
```


We can also redirect the `STDOUT` as well to for example a **text based** file (basically create a file will all of the output.
```shell-session
find /etc/ -name shadow 2>/dev/null > results.txt
```

We can also separate those different outputs to different files if wished like so:
```shell-session
find /etc/ -name shadow 2> stderr.txt 1> stdout.txt
```

We can also work with `<` to write changes or override them however if we wish to append changes we can use `<<` like so :
```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ find /etc/ -name passwd >> stdout.txt 2>/dev/null
```

#### Pipes
- Another way to redirect `STDOUT` is to use pipes (`|`). These are useful when we want to use the `STDOUT` from one program to be processed by another.
- Grep is used to filter `STDOUT` according to the pattern we define.
![[Pasted image 20231023201757.png]]
we use the `find` command to search for all files in the "`/etc/`" directory with a "`.conf`" extension. Any errors are redirected to the "`null device`" (`/dev/null`). Using `grep`, we filter out the results and specify that only the lines containing the pattern "`systemd`" should be displayed. we will use the tool called `wc`, which should count the total number of obtained results.
```shell-session
find /etc/ -name *.conf 2>/dev/null | grep systemd | wc -l
```



*HTB Solutions:*
Find a number of `.log` files:
``` 
find  / -type f -name * .log | wc
```
Find total number of packages installed on the system:
```
dpkg -l | grep -c '^ii'
```

## Filter contents
---

| Command  | Description                                                                                                                        |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| \   | is a pager which reads contents in interactive way. Output remains in the terminal                                                 |
| `less`   | is another pages with more features than `more`. The presentation is the same however the outputs does not remain in the terminal. |
| `head`   | prints only first ten lines of output unless specified otherwise                                                                   |

| `sort`   | is used to sort through files alphabetically or numerically                                                                        |
| `grep`   | will only search for specific results that contain patterns we have defined. `-v` is used to to exclude specific results           |
| `cut`    | It removes specific delimiters. we can use `-d":"` to remove colons and use `f` to define option in the line we want to output     |
| `tr`     | can replace characters   similar to cut                                                                                            |
| `column` | is used to represents data in more structured way                                                                                  |
| `awk`    | helps sort out results which allows us to display the first (`$1`) and last (`$NF`) result of the line                             |
| `sed`    | modifies output using patterns                                                                                                     |
| `wc`     | counts the outputs for us. `-l` counts the lines                                                                                   |


```shell-session
more /etc/passwd 
less /etc/passwd
head /etc/passwd
tail /etc/passwd
cat /etc/passwd | sort
cat /etc/passwd | grep "/bin/bash"
cat /etc/passwd | grep -v "false\|nologin"

- How many services are listening on the target system on all interfaces? (not on localhost and ipv4 only):
```
netstat -ln4 | grep LISTEN | grep -v 127 | wc -l
```
- Determine what user the ProFTPd server is running under. Submit the username as the answer.
```
ps aux | grep proftpd
```
- Use cURL from your Pwnbox (not the target machine) to obtain the source code of the "https://www.inlanefreight.com" website and filter all unique paths of that domain. Submit the number of these paths as the answer.
```
curl https://www.inlanefreight.com/ | grep -Eo "https:\/\/.{0,3}\.inlanefreight\.com[^\"\']*" | sort -u | wc -l
```

## Regular expressions
---
**RedEx** is an expression language to search for patterns in text and files. They can be used to replace text, analyse data, validate input, perform searches, and more. In simple terms it's a **filter**.

|     | **Operators** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                             |
| --- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | `(a)`         | The round brackets are used to group parts of a regex. Within the brackets, you can define further patterns which should be processed together.                             |
| 2   | `[a-z]`       | The square brackets are used to define character classes. Inside the brackets, you can specify a list of characters to search for.                                          |
| 3   | `{1,10}`      | The curly brackets are used to define quantifiers. Inside the brackets, you can specify a number or a range that indicates how often a previous pattern should be repeated. |
| 4   | `\|`          | Also called the OR operator and shows results when one of the two expressions matches                                                                                       |
| 5   | `.*`          | Also called the AND operator and displayed results only if both expressions match                                                                                           |
|     |               |                                                                                                                                                                             |

*OR* operator:
```shell-session
cry0l1t3@htb:~$ grep -E "(my|false)" /etc/passwd

lxd:x:105:65534::/var/lib/lxd/:/bin/false
pollinate:x:109:1::/var/cache/pollinate:/bin/false
mysql:x:116:120:MySQL Server,,:/nonexistent:/bin/false
```

*AND* operator
```shell-session
cry0l1t3@htb:~$ grep -E "(my.*false)" /etc/passwd

mysql:x:116:120:MySQL Server,,:/nonexistent:/bin/false
```

## Permission management
---
- **Traverse the directory** - means navigating to that directory which requires user to have **execute** permissions on the directory. Without the permission the user cannot access the directory's contents.
- **Execute permission only allows users to traverse** to the directory and view the content within that directory.
- To modify contents of the directory user needs **write** permissions to add/remove rename etc 
- Permission system on Linux is based on **octal number system** and there are three different types of permission:
	``-(r) - Read``
	``-(w) - Write``
	``-(x) - Execute``
- The permissions can be set for the `owner`, `group`, and `others` like presented in the next example with their corresponding permissions.
![[Pasted image 20231116131641.png]]
^^^ *this here very useful*
### Change permissions
`chmod` command is used to change permissions, permission group references:
1. **u** - owner
2. **g** -  group
3. **o** - others 
4. **a** - all

Changing `Music` permission to **write** for all:
``` This changes music foldedr to be accessable for everyone
┌──(lukas㉿pandoraBox)-[~]
└─$ chmod a-w Music/
```

We can use octal values to change the permissions as well where 1 stands for permission given and 0 for permission denied:
![[Pasted image 20231116133053.png]]

### Change owner
`chown` command is being used to change the owner. The syntax looks like this:
```shell-session
cry0l1t3@htb[/htb]$ chown <user>:<group> <file/directory>
```

To change `Music` folder to user
```shell-session
chown root:lukas Music/
```

Besides assigning direct user and group permissions, we can also configure special permissions for files by setting the `Set User ID` (`SUID`) and `Set Group ID` (`SGID`) bits. These `SUID`/`SGID` bits allow, for example, users to run programs with the rights of another user. Administrators often use this to give their users special rights for certain applications or files. The letter "`s`" is used instead of an "`x`". When executing such a program, the SUID/SGID of the file owner is used.

Sticky Bits
When a sticky bit is set on a directory, it is represented by the letter “`t`" in the execute permission of the directory's permissions. For example, if a directory has permissions “`rwxrwxrwt`", it means that the sticky bit is set, giving the extra level of security so that no one other than the owner or root user can delete or rename the files or folders in the directory.
If the sticky bit is capitalized (`T`), then this means that all other users do not have `execute` (`x`) permissions and, therefore, cannot see the contents of the folder nor run any programs from it. The lowercase sticky bit (`t`) is the sticky bit where the `execute` (`x`) permissions have been set.

### User Management 
Commands for user commands:

| **Command**    | **Description**                                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sudo`     | Execute command as a different user.                                                                                                                       |
| `su`       | The `su` utility requests appropriate user credentials via PAM and switches to that user ID (the default user is the superuser). A shell is then executed. |
| `useradd`  | Creates a new user or update default new user information.                                                                                                 |
| `userdel`  | Deletes a user account and related files.                                                                                                                  |
| `usermod`  | Modifies a user account.                                                                                                                                   |
| `addgroup` | Adds a group to the system.                                                                                                                                |
| `delgroup` | Removes a group from the system.                                                                                                                           |
| `passwd`   | Changes user password.                                                                                                                                     |
### Package manager
The features that most package management systems provide are:

- Package downloading
- Dependency resolution
- A standard binary package format
- Common installation and configuration locations
- Additional system-related configuration and functionality
- Quality control

| **Command** | **Description** |
| ---- | ---- |
| `dpkg` | The `dpkg` is a tool to install, build, remove, and manage Debian packages. The primary and more user-friendly front-end for `dpkg` is aptitude. |
| `apt` | Apt provides a high-level command-line interface for the package management system. |
| `aptitude` | Aptitude is an alternative to apt and is a high-level interface to the package manager. |
| `snap` | Install, configure, refresh, and remove snap packages. Snaps enable the secure distribution of the latest apps and utilities for the cloud, servers, desktops, and the internet of things. |
| `gem` | Gem is the front-end to RubyGems, the standard package manager for Ruby. |
| `pip` | Pip is a Python package installer recommended for installing Python packages that are not available in the Debian archive. It can work with version control repositories (currently only Git, Mercurial, and Bazaar repositories), logs output extensively, and prevents partial installs by downloading all requirements before starting installation. |
| `git` | Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals. |
### Service and process management
The most commonly used are:

|**Signal**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`1`|`SIGHUP` - This is sent to a process when the terminal that controls it is closed.|
|`2`|`SIGINT` - Sent when a user presses `[Ctrl] + C` in the controlling terminal to interrupt a process.|
|`3`|`SIGQUIT` - Sent when a user presses `[Ctrl] + D` to quit.|
|`9`|`SIGKILL` - Immediately kill a process with no clean-up operations.|
|`15`|`SIGTERM` - Program termination.|
|`19`|`SIGSTOP` - Stop the program. It cannot be handled anymore.|
|`20`|`SIGTSTP` - Sent when a user presses `[Ctrl] + Z` to request for a service to suspend. The user can handle it afterward.|

For example, if a program were to freeze, we could force to kill it with the following command:

```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ kill 9 <PID> 
```

### Task scheduling
**Cron tool** is an automotive tools used for scheduling tasks by setting update command every now and then.

| **Time Frame**         | **Description**                                                       |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Minutes (0-59)         | This specifies in which minute the task should be executed.           |
| Hours (0-23)           | This specifies in which hour the task should be executed.             |
| Days of month (1-31)   | This specifies on which day of the month the task should be executed. |
| Months (1-12)          | This specifies in which month the task should be executed.            |
| Days of the week (0-7) | This specifies on which day of the week the task should be executed.  |

For example, such a crontab could look like this:

Code: txt

```txt
# System Update
* */6 * * /path/to/update_software.sh

# Execute scripts
0 0 1 * * /path/to/scripts/run_scripts.sh

# Cleanup DB
0 0 * * 0 /path/to/scripts/clean_database.sh

# Backups
0 0 * * 7 /path/to/scripts/backup.sh
```

### Network and services
Secure shell `ssh` is a protocol that enables secure transmission of data and commands over the network. One of the tools that are using ssh protocol is `OpenSSH` server. OpenSSH can be configured and customized by editing the file `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` with a text editor.

**Installation**:
```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ sudo apt install openssh-server -y
```

---
Network File System (**NFS**) is a network protocol that allows us to store and manage files on remote systems as if they were stored on the local system. It can also be used to share and manage resources efficiently, e.g., to replicate file systems between servers. It also offers features such as *access controls, real-time file transfer, and support for multiple users accessing data simultaneously*. We can use this service just like **FTP** in case there is no FTP client installed on the target system, or NFS is running instead of FTP.

**Installation:**
```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ sudo apt install nfs-kernel-server -y
```

### Working with web services
Apache2 is the most widely spread server for web hosting. It can be used to encrypt communication between web browser and server, user proxy server or perform complex manipulation of html header data.
Apache offers the possibility to create web pages dynamically using server-side scripting languages. Commonly used scripting languages are PHP, Perl, or Ruby. Other languages are Python, JavaScript, Lua, and .NET, which can be used for this. We can install the Apache webserver with the following command.

**Installation:**
```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ apt install apache2 -y
```

`cURL` is a tool that allows us to transfer files from the shell over protocols like **HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SFTP, FTPS, or SCP**. Gives us the possibility to control and test websites remotely. Besides the remote servers' content, we can also view individual requests to look at the client's and server's communication. Alternative is `wget` the difference to curl is that the website content is downloaded and stored locally.

### Back and Restore
Backing up tools:
- **Rsync** - it only transmits the changed parts of a file,  useful for transferring large amounts of data.
- **Deja Dup** - copies of data on local or remote storage media.
- **Duplicity** - It also uses Rsync as a backend and additionally offers the possibility to encrypt backup copies and store them on remote storage media.
Tool used to encrypt backups:
- GnuPG
- eCryptfs
- LUKS

**Backup process**
1. Rsyncs back up commands (it will copy the directory to back up server):
```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ rsync -av /path/to/mydirectory user@backup_server:/path/to/backup/directory
```
2. Extra added features (compression and incremental bakcups):
```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ rsync -avz --backup --backup-dir=/path/to/backup/folder --delete /path/to/mydirectory user@backup_server:/path/to/backup/directory
```
3. To restore:
```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ rsync -av user@remote_host:/path/to/backup/directory /path/to/mydirectory
```
4. Secure transfer:
 ```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ rsync -avz -e ssh /path/to/mydirectory user@backup_server:/path/to/backup/directory
```
5. tools such as `cron` can be used to automise the whole process of synchronisation between devices 
```bash
#!/bin/bash
rsync -avz -e ssh /path/to/mydirectory user@backup_server:/path/to/backup/directory
```

### File system management
The main tools being used for file system management is `fdisk`. It allows us to create, delete  and manage partitions on a drive. It also displays the meta data for each partition. Other tools are `gpart`, and `GParted`.

Command:
```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ sudo fdisk -l
```
**Mounting** is a process of assigning partition or a drive to a specific directory, making it accessible to the file system hierarchy. Once the drive/partition is mounted it can be manipulated like any other system directory. `mount` tool is used to perform all actions. `/etc/fstab` file is used to define the default file systems that are mounted at boot time.

**USB mounting**:
```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usb
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ cd /mnt/usb && ls -l
```
**Unmount**:
```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ sudo umount /mnt/usb
```

# Network configuration
Network access control **(NAC)** is a critical part of network configuration. There are different NAC technologies:
- Discretionary access control (**DAC**) Owner/s decide who has the access
- Mandatory access control (**MAC**) - hierarchy access
- Role-based access control (**RBAC**) - prepared roles have different access polices.

**NAC enforcement** - SELinux polices, configuring AppArmour profiles, TCP wrappers for access control.
**Monitoring traffic** - syslog, syslog, ss, lsof, ELK stack
**Testing** - ping, nslookup, nmap

# Configuring network interface

Displaying all networking devices:

**ip**:

```shell-session
cry0l1t3@htb:~$ ip addr
```

**Activating network interface:**

```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ sudo ip link set eth0 up
```

**Assign IP Address to an interface**:

```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.2
```

**Assign a netmask to an interface**:

```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ sudo ifconfig eth0 netmask 255.255.255.0
```

`/etc/resolv.conf` file is the DNS server infromation
`/etc/network/uinterfaces` file defines network interfaces for linux. It should look something like this:
```txt
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
  address 192.168.1.2
  netmask 255.255.255.0
  gateway 192.168.1.1
  dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4
```

By setting the `eth0` network interface to use a static IP address of `192.168.1.2`, with a netmask of `255.255.255.0` and a default gateway of `192.168.1.1`, we can ensure that your network connection remains stable and reliable. Additionally, by specifying DNS servers of `8.8.8.8` and `8.8.4.4`, we can ensure that our computer can easily access the internet and resolve domain names. Once we have made these changes to the configuration file, saving the file and exiting the editor is important. After that, we must restart the networking service to apply the changes.

**Restart networking service**

```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ sudo systemctl restart networking
```

**Shows IP addresses of the devices that the packets pass through**:

```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ traceroute  8.8.8.8
```

# Linux security

 `/etc/hosts.allow` 
 
```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/hosts.allow

# Allow access to SSH from the local network
sshd : 10.129.14.0/24

# Allow access to FTP from a specific host
ftpd : 10.129.14.10

# Allow access to Telnet from any host in the inlanefreight.local domain
telnetd : .inlanefreight.local
```

`/etc/hosts.deny`

```shell-session
lukan1u@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/hosts.deny

# Deny access to all services from any host in the inlanefreight.com domain
ALL : .inlanefreight.com

# Deny access to SSH from a specific host
sshd : 10.129.22.22z

# Deny access to FTP from hosts with IP addresses in the range of 10.129.22.0 to 10.129.22.255
ftpd : 10.129.22.0/24
```
