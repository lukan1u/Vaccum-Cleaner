**Topologies** - Mesh, tree, star
**Medium** - ethernet, fiber, coax, wireless
**Protocols** - TCP, UDP, IPX

On a network computer can talk to each other as long as `192.168.1.xxx` is the same except the xxx with /24 as default subnet mask.
Adding subnet mask `/25` will divide network where devices with that subnet will be able to communicate with each other but not anything else.
![[Pasted image 20240127141336.png]]

The difference between `URL`s and `FQDN`s is that:
- an `FQDN` (`www.hackthebox.eu`) only specifies the address of the "building" and
- an `URL` (`https://www.hackthebox.eu/example?floor=2&office=dev&employee=17`) also specifies the "`floor`," "`office`," "`mailbox`" and the corresponding "`employee`" for whom the package is intended.

We do not know the exact geographical location of the address but here is why we need ISP because in this scenario they would be like a post office that has all information needed to reach the correct address. Router communicates with ISP and ISP communicates with other networks.

As soon as we send our packet through our post office (`router`), the packet is forwarded to the `main post office` (`ISP`). This main post office looks in the `address register`/`phonebook` (`Domain Name Service`) where this address is located and returns the corresponding geographical coordinates (`IP address`). Now that we know the address's exact location, our packet is sent directly there by a direct flight via our main post office.

1. The Web Server should be in a DMZ (Demilitarized Zone). It should be placed in separate network because clients and directly communicate with the server which can be compromised.
2. Workstations should be on their own network and each workstation should have a Host Based Firewall rule preventing it from talking to other workstations.
3. The Switch and Router should be on an "Administration Network" This prevents workstations from snooping in on any communications between these devices.
4. IP Phones should be on their own network. Security- wise this is to prevent computers from being able to eavesdrop on communication.
5. Printers should be on their own network.

# Network types
---

|**Network Type**|**Definition**|
|---|---|
|Wide Area Network (WAN)|Internet|
|Local Area Network (LAN)|Internal Networks (Ex: Home or Office)|
|Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)|Internal Networks accessible over Wi-Fi|
|Virtual Private Network (VPN)|Connects multiple network sites to one `LAN`|
**WAN** - is usually refereed as the Internet. WAN is the address  with large number of LANs joined together. Many governments or large companies will have an "Internal WAN" (also called Intranet Airgap Network). To identify WAN is to use WAN specific routing protocols such as BGP and if the IP Schema is in use is not within RFC 1918.

**LAN / WLAN** - there is not much difference between LAN or WLAN. Both use RFC 1918 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16. WLAN doesn't needs cables.

**VPN** - making user feel as if they were plugged into a different network.
- **Site-To-Site VPN** -Client and server are network devices typically either Routers or Firewalls, and share entire network ranges. This is most commonly used to join company networks together over the internet.
- **Remote Access VPN** - Creating a virtual interface that behaves as if it is on a client's network. When analysing these VPNs it's important to consider routing table that is created when joining the VPN. If the VPN creates routes for specific networks (for example 10.10.10.0/24) this is called a `Split-Tunnel VPN` meaning the connection is not going out of the VPN. It's good for HTB because there is no concern of monitoring however companies may not like it because infected machines cannot be scanned for malware.
- **SSL VPN** - This is essentially a VPN that is done within our web browser and is becoming increasingly common as web browsers are becoming capable of doing anything. Typically these will stream applications or entire desktop sessions to your web browser. A great example of this would be the HackTheBox Pwnbox.

|Network Type|Definition|
|---|---|
|Global Area Network (GAN)|Global network (the Internet)|
|Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)|Regional network (multiple LANs)|
|Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN)|Personal network (Bluetooth)|

**GAN** - A worldwide network such as the Internet. Internationally active companies also maintain isolated networks that span several WANs and connect company computers worldwide. GANs use the glass fibres infrastructure of wide area networks and interconnect them by international undersea cables or satellite transmission.

**MAN** - Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) - is a broadband telecommunications network that connects several LANs in geographical proximity. These are individual branches of a company connected to a MAN via leased lines. High-performance routers and high-performance connections based on glass fibbers are used. Internationally operating network operatos provide the infrastructure for MANs. Cities wired as `Metropolitan Area Networks` can be integrated supra-regionally in `Wide Area Networks` (`WAN`) and internationally in `Global Area Networks` (`GAN`).

**PAN / WPAN** - Modern end devices such as smartphones can be connected ad hoc to form a network to enable data exchange. These can be done via the cable. WPAN is wireless version of that and a good example is Bluetooth and it is also called Piconet. These networks are usually short distance. Protocols such as Insteon, Z-Wave, and ZigBee were explicitly designed for smart homes and home automation.

# Network Topologies
---
It's arrangement of **physical and logical** connection of devices in a network. Computers are hosts, such as clients and servers. It's also in combination with switches, bridges and routers so that the network can function.

**Transmission medium layout** is used to connect devices in the physical topology of the network.
It's a cabling plan of the position of the nodes and cables in-between those nodes.
**Logical topology** refers to how singles act on the network and how data will be transmitted from one device to another across the whole physical network.

**Connections**:

|`Wired connections`|`Wireless connections`|
|---|---|
|Coaxial cabling|Wi-Fi|
|Glass fiber cabling|Cellular|
|Twisted-pair cabling|Satellite|
|and others|and others|

**Firewalls** - Network Interface Controller (NICs): 

| Repeaters | Hubs | Bridges | Switches |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Router/Modem | Gateways | Firewalls |  |
**Network topologies**:
- **Point to point** - direct connection of two devices. They're not P2P (peer to peer architecture)![[Pasted image 20240202181907.png]]
- **Star** - Each device is connected to central network component via a separate link. This is usually a router, hub or a switch. These handle  forwarding function for the data packets. The data traffic is high  because all data and connections go through central network component.![[Pasted image 20240202182109.png]]
- **Mesh** - Many nodes decide about connections on a physical level and the routing on a logical level. Meshed structures have no fixed topology. Each host is connected to every other host in the network in a **fully meshed structure**. This is used in WAN or MAN to ensure high reliability and bandwidth. If router fails there is always another one to replace it. Each node on fully meshed structure  has the same routing functions and knows the neighbouring nodes it can communicate with proximity to the network gateway and traffic loads. In **partially meshed structure** the endpoints are connected by only one connection.![[Pasted image 20240202183746.png]]
- **Hybrid** - Hybrid networks combine two or more topologies so that the resulting network does not present any standard topologies.  A hybrid topology is always created when `two different` basic network topologies are interconnected.
![[Pasted image 20240202184044.png]]

- **Bus** - Every host has access to the transmission medium. There is no central network component that controls the processes on it.  On bus network only one host can send and all the others can only receive and check  data is intended for them ![[Pasted image 20240202181856.png]]
- **Ring** - each host or node has connection coming to and from the device. It does not require active network component. The control and access to the transmission medium are regulated by a protocol to which all stations adhere. Also it is using a token which is a bit pattern that continually passes through a ring network in one direction which works according to the claim token process.![[Pasted image 20240202182723.png]]
- **Tree** - extended star topology that more extensive local network have in this structure. This is useful when several topologies are combined. There are both logical tree structures according to the `spanning tree` and physical ones. Tree topologies are also used for `broadband networks` and `city networks` (`MAN`).
![[Pasted image 20240202183958.png]]


- **Daisy Chain**- In the daisy chain topology, multiple hosts are connected by placing a cable from one node to another. Since this creates a chain of connections, it is also known as a daisy-chain configuration in which multiple hardware components are connected in a series. This type of networking is often found in automation technology (`CAN`).![[Pasted image 20240202184135.png]]

# Proxies
---
It's a device or service that sits in the middle of connection and acts as a mediator. It inspects the contents of the traffic. Without the mediator usually a device is a gateway not a proxy.

Key proxies:
- `Dedicated Proxy` / `Forward Proxy`
- `Reverse Proxy`
- `Transparent Proxy`

**Dedicated Proxy / Forward Proxy** - is when a client makes a request to a computer and that computer carries out the request to a server etc. For example corporate networks may have sensitive information therefore to access the website the requests must go through a proxy such as web filter to access that websites to maintain security.
![[Pasted image 20240202190003.png]]

**Reverse Proxy** -  it filters incoming transfers and is the opposite of forward proxy. The most common goal with a reverse proxy is to listen on a an address and forward it to a closed-off network. Penetration testers will configure reverse proxies on infected endpoints.
- **IDS (intrusion detection system)** used to watch external web requests.
- **ModSecurity, a Web Application Firewall (WAF)** used to inspect web requests for malicious content and block and request if it is malicious.
![[Pasted image 20240229120946.png]]

**(Non-)Transparent Proxy:**
- **Transparent proxy** is where client doesn't know about its existence. The transparent proxy intercepts the client's communication requests to the Internet and acts as a substitute instance. To the outside, the transparent proxy, like the non-transparent proxy, acts as a communication partner.
- **Non-transparent proxy** is where we must be informed about its existence. For this purpose, we and the software we want to use are given a special proxy configuration that ensures that traffic to the Internet is first addressed to the proxy. If this configuration does not exist, we cannot communicate via the proxy. However, since the proxy usually provides the only communication path to other networks, communication to the Internet is generally cut off without a corresponding proxy configuration.

# Networking Models
---
![[Pasted image 20240311211442.png]]

-  **OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnection model** published by the **international telecommunication Union (ITU)** and is often referred to as the ISO/OSI layer model (also similar to TCP/IP Model).

- **TCP/IP Model** - the entire internet is based of the `TCP/IP` protocol family. It is responsible for the switching and transport of data packets on the internet. Also UDP and ICMP belong to that protocol family because it's not excessively limited ti IP and TCP.

### ISO/OSI vs TCP/IP and PDU
TCP/IP is a communication protocol that allows hosts to connect to the internet. where as OSI is a communication gateway between the network and end-user. It is also known for tis strict protocol and limitations.

- **PDU** -  In a layered system, devices in a layer exchange data in a different format called a `protocol data unit` (`PDU`). For example, when we want to browse a website on the computer, the remote server software first passes the requested data to the application layer. It is processed layer by layer, each layer performing its assigned functions. The data is then transferred through the network's physical layer until the destination server or another device receives it. The data is routed through the layers again, with each layer performing its assigned operations until the receiving software uses the data.
- During the transmission, each layer adds a `header` to the `PDU` from the upper layer, which controls and identifies the packet. This process is called `encapsulation`. The header and the data together form the PDU for the next layer. The process continues to the `Physical Layer` or `Network Layer`, where the data is transmitted to the receiver.
![[Pasted image 20240311211703.png]]

`TCP/IP`, we can quickly understand how the entire connection is established, and with `ISO`, we can take it apart piece by piece and analyse it in detail.

## The OSI model in detail
The whole point of OSI model was that it enables the communication of different system via various devices and technologies and provides compatibility. It's not being used but it helps us understand how the network works.

| **Layer**        | **Function**                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `7.Application`  | Among other things, this layer controls the input and output of data and provides the application functions.                                                                                                                |
| `6.Presentation` | The presentation layer's task is to transfer the system-dependent presentation of data into a form independent of the application.                                                                                          |
| `5.Session`      | The session layer controls the logical connection between two systems and prevents, for example, connection breakdowns or other problems.                                                                                   |
| `4.Transport`    | Layer 4 is used for end-to-end control of the transferred data. The Transport Layer can detect and avoid congestion situations and segment data streams.                                                                    |
| `3.Network`      | On the networking layer, connections are established in circuit-switched networks, and data packets are forwarded in packet-switched networks. Data is transmitted over the entire network from the sender to the receiver. |
| `2.Data Link`    | The central task of layer 2 is to enable reliable and error-free transmissions on the respective medium. For this purpose, the bitstreams from layer 1 are divided into blocks or frames.                                   |
| `1.Physical`     | The transmission techniques used are, for example, electrical signals, optical signals, or electromagnetic waves. Through layer 1, the transmission takes place on wired or wireless transmission lines.                    |

## TCP/IP Model
---
TCP/IP is also a reference model called Internet Protocol Suite. IP is located in network layer 3 and TCP in transport layer 4 of the OSI layer model.

| **Layer**       | **Function**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `4.Application` | The Application Layer allows applications to access the other layers' services and defines the protocols applications use to exchange data.                                                                                                     |
| `3.Transport`   | The Transport Layer is responsible for providing (TCP) session and (UDP) datagram services for the Application Layer.                                                                                                                           |
| `2.Internet`    | The Internet Layer is responsible for host addressing, packaging, and routing functions.                                                                                                                                                        |
| `1.Link`        | The Link layer is responsible for placing the TCP/IP packets on the network medium and receiving corresponding packets from the network medium. TCP/IP is designed to work independently of the network access method, frame format, and medium |
TCP/IP can transfer data over any network not matter where the receiver is located. IP ensures the data packets reach destination and TCP controls the data transfer and ensures the connection between data stream and application.

|**Task**|**Protocol**|**Description**|
|---|---|---|
|`Logical Addressing`|`IP`|Due to many hosts in different networks, there is a need to structure the network topology and logical addressing. Within TCP/IP, IP takes over the logical addressing of networks and nodes. Data packets only reach the network where they are supposed to be. The methods to do so are `network classes`, `subnetting`, and `CIDR`.|
|`Routing`|`IP`|For each data packet, the next node is determined in each node on the way from the sender to the receiver. This way, a data packet is routed to its receiver, even if its location is unknown to the sender.|
|`Error & Control Flow`|`TCP`|The sender and receiver are frequently in touch with each other via a virtual connection. Therefore control messages are sent continuously to check if the connection is still established.|
|`Application Support`|`TCP`|TCP and UDP ports form a software abstraction to distinguish specific applications and their communication links.|
|`Name Resolution`|`DNS`|DNS provides name resolution through Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN) in IP addresses, enabling us to reach the desired host with the specified name on the internet.|
## Network Layer
---

The network layer (layer 3) of OSI controls the exchange of data packets as these cannot be directly routed to the receiver and therefore have to be provided with routing nodes. To achieve this the network layer identifies the individual network nodes, sets up and clears connection channels, and takes care of routing and data flow control. It's responsible for:
- Logical Addressing
- Routing

The protocols used in Network Layer (In the OSI protocols are defined in each layer.):
- `IPv4 / IPv6`
- `IPsec`
- `ICMP`
- `IGMP`
- `RIP`
- `OSPF`
It's not always possible for packets to reach destination therefore they will be sent to the next node that you will put all data together ready for the collection when needed.

## IP Addresses
---
**MAC (Media Access Control)** address can be used to establish connection between hosts on the same network however it wouldn't be enough to connect to another another host with different network. To achieve connection between two different hosts on two different networks we would have to use IPv4 or IPv6 address which is made up of the network address and the host address.
- `IPv4` / `IPv6` - describes the unique postal address and district of the receiver's building.
- `MAC` - describes the exact floor and apartment of the receiver.


### IPv4 Structure
IPv4 consists of a 32-bit binary cumber combined into 4 bytes consisting of 8-bit groups (coresets ranging from 0-255)

|**Notation**|**Presentation**|
|---|---|
|Binary|0111 1111.0000 0000.0000 0000.0000 0001|
|Decimal|127.0.0.1|
Each network interface is assigned a unique IP address. The IPv4 format allows 4,294,967,296 unique addresses. The IP address is divided into a host part and network part. Router assigns the host part and network administrator assigns the network part. On the Internet, this is IANA, which allocates and manages the unique IPs. The IP network blocks were divided into classes A-E:

|**`Class`**|**Network Address**|**First Address**|**Last Address**|**Subnetmask**|**CIDR**|**Subnets**|**IPs**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|`A`|1.0.0.0|1.0.0.1|127.255.255.255|255.0.0.0|/8|127|16,777,214 + 2|
|`B`|128.0.0.0|128.0.0.1|191.255.255.255|255.255.0.0|/16|16,384|65,534 + 2|
|`C`|192.0.0.0|192.0.0.1|223.255.255.255|255.255.255.0|/24|2,097,152|254 + 2|
|`D`|224.0.0.0|224.0.0.1|239.255.255.255|Multicast|Multicast|Multicast|Multicast|
|`E`|240.0.0.0|240.0.0.1|255.255.255.255|reserved|reserved|reserved|reserved|
### Subnet Mask
Further separation is done using subnetting and this is achieved by using netmasks, which is as long as the IPv4 address. As with the classes, it describes which bit position within the IP address act as network part or host part.

|**Class**|**Network Address**|**First Address**|**Last Address**|**`Subnetmask`**|**CIDR**|**Subnets**|**IPs**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**A**|1.0.0.0|1.0.0.1|127.255.255.255|`255.0.0.0`|/8|127|16,777,214 + 2|
|**B**|128.0.0.0|128.0.0.1|191.255.255.255|`255.255.0.0`|/16|16,384|65,534 + 2|
|**C**|192.0.0.0|192.0.0.1|223.255.255.255|`255.255.255.0`|/24|2,097,152|254 + 2|
|**D**|224.0.0.0|224.0.0.1|239.255.255.255|`Multicast`|Multicast|Multicast|Multicast|
|**E**|240.0.0.0|240.0.0.1|255.255.255.255|`reserved`|reserved|reserved|reserved|
### Network and Gateway Addresses
Default Gateway is simply a router that couples networks and system with different protocols and manages addresses and transmission methods. It is common for default gateway to be assigned first or last assignable IPv4 in a subnet. The two additional IPs in the column are reserved  for network address and the broadcast address.

| **Class** | **Network Address** | **`First Address`** | **Last Address** | **Subnetmask** | **CIDR**  | **Subnets** | **`IPs`**        |
| --------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------- | -------------- | --------- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| A         | 1.0.0.0             | `1.0.0.1`           | 127.255.255.255  | 255.0.0.0      | /8        | 127         | 16,777,214 `+ 2` |
| B         | 128.0.0.0           | `128.0.0.1`         | 191.255.255.255  | 255.255.0.0    | /16       | 16,384      | 65,534 `+ 2`     |
| C         | 192.0.0.0           | `192.0.0.1`         | 223.255.255.255  | 255.255.255.0  | /24       | 2,097,152   | 254 `+ 2`        |
| D         | 224.0.0.0           | `224.0.0.1`         | 239.255.255.255  | Multicast      | Multicast | Multicast   | Multicast        |
| E         | 240.0.0.0           | `240.0.0.1`         | 255.255.255.255  | reserved       | reserved  | reserved    | reserved         |
|           |                     |                     |                  |                |           |             |                  |

### Broadcast Address
Broadcast in a network is a message that is transmitted to all participants of a network and does not require any response. It uses it IP address which the receivers can use to contact it. That last IPv4 address that is used for the broadcast.

| **lass** | **Network Address** | **First Address** | **`Last Address`** | **Subnetmask** | **CIDR**  | **Subnets** | **IPs**        |

## Binary system
An IPv4 address is divided into 4 octets, as we have already seen. Each `octet` consists of `8 bits`. Each position of a bit in an octet has a specific decimal value. Let's take the following IPv4 address as an example:

- IPv4 Address: `192.168.10.39`
```shell-session
Values:         128  64  32  16  8  4  2  1
Binary:           1   1   0   0  0  0  0  0
```


- IPv4 Address: `192.168.10.39`
```shell-session
Octet:             1st         2nd         3rd         4th
Binary:         1100 0000 . 1010 1000 . 0000 1010 . 0010 0111
Decimal:           192    .    168    .     10    .     39
```
This addition takes place for each octet, which results in a decimal representation of the `IPv4 address`. The subnet mask is calculated in the same way.

### CIDR
**Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)**. The CIDR suffix indicates how many bits from the beginning of the IPv4 address belong to the network. Its whole point is to simplify tracking of all the hosts on the network and more efficient allocation of IP addresses. The suffix is calculated by  adding up the sum of 1-bits.

# Subnetting
---
Subnetting is like a floor in an apartment building. The benefits of is security efficiency and scalability  because it allows us to isolate the network or/and keep the local communication within the subnet or/and adding new devices to subnets or creating new floors/departments. It consists of the following:
- `Network address`
- `Broadcast address`
- `First host`
- `Last host`
- `Number of hosts`

Let us take the following IPv4 address and subnet mask as an example:
- IPv4 Address: `192.168.12.160`
- Subnet Mask: `255.255.255.192`
- CIDR: `192.168.12.160/26`
We already know that an IP address is divided into the `network part` and the `host part`.

 **Network Part:**

| **Details of** | **1st Octet** | **2nd Octet** | **3rd Octet** | **4th Octet** | **Decimal**         |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| IPv4           | `1100 0000`   | `1010 1000`   | `0000 1100`   | `10`10 0000   | 192.168.12.160`/26` |
| Subnet mask    | `1111 1111`   | `1111 1111`   | `1111 1111`   | `11`00 0000   | `255.255.255.192`   |
| Bits           | /8            | /16           | /24           | /32           |                     |
In subnetting, we use the subnet mask as a template for the IPv4 address. From the `1`-bits in the subnet mask, we know which bits in the IPv4 address `cannot` be changed. These are `fixed` and therefore determine the "main network" in which the subnet is located.

**Host Part:**

|**Details of**|**1st Octet**|**2nd Octet**|**3rd Octet**|**4th Octet**|**Decimal**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|IPv4|1100 0000|1010 1000|0000 1100|10`10 0000`|192.168.12.160/26|
|Subnet mask|1111 1111|1111 1111|1111 1111|11`00 0000`|255.255.255.192|
|Bits|/8|/16|/24|/32|
- The bits in the `host part` can be changed to the `first` and `last` address. The first address is the `network address`, and the last address is the `broadcast address` for the respective subnet.
- The `network address` is vital for the delivery of a data packet. If the `network address` is the same for the source and destination address, the data packet is delivered within the same subnet. If the network addresses are different, the data packet must be routed to another subnet via the `default gateway`.
- The `subnet mask` determines where this separation occurs.

**Separation of Network & Host Parts**:

|**Details of**|**1st Octet**|**2nd Octet**|**3rd Octet**|**4th Octet**|**Decimal**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|IPv4|1100 0000|1010 1000|0000 1100|10`\|`10 0000|192.168.12.160/26|
|Subnet mask|`1111 1111`|`1111 1111`|`1111 1111`|`11\|`00 0000|255.255.255.192|
|Bits|/8|/16|/24|/32|

**Network Address**:
So if we now set all bits to `0` in the `host part` of the IPv4 address, we get the respective subnet's `network address`. 128 end is the broadcast.

| **Details of** | **1st Octet** | **2nd Octet** | **3rd Octet** | **4th Octet** | **Decimal**         |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| IPv4           | 1100 0000     | 1010 1000     | 0000 1100     | 10`\|00 0000` | `192.168.12.128`/26 |
| Subnet mask    | `1111 1111`   | `1111 1111`   | `1111 1111`   | `11\|`00 0000 | 255.255.255.192     |
| Bits           | /8            | /16           | /24           | /32           |                     |

**Broadcast Address**:
If we set all bits in the `host part` of the IPv4 address to `1`, we get the `broadcast address`.

|**Details of**|**1st Octet**|**2nd Octet**|**3rd Octet**|**4th Octet**|**Decimal**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|IPv4|1100 0000|1010 1000|0000 1100|10`\|11 1111`|`192.168.12.191`/26|
|Subnet mask|`1111 1111`|`1111 1111`|`1111 1111`|`11\|`00 0000|255.255.255.192|
|Bits|/8|/16|/24|/32|
Since we now know that the IPv4 addresses `192.168.12.128` and `192.168.12.191` are assigned, all other IPv4 addresses are accordingly between `192.168.12.129-190`. Now we know that this subnet offers us a total of `64 - 2` (network address & broadcast address) or `62` IPv4 addresses that we can assign to our hosts.

|**Hosts**|**IPv4**|
|---|---|
|Network Address|`192.168.12.128`|
|First Host|`192.168.12.129`|
|Other Hosts|`...`|
|Last Host|`192.168.12.190`|
|Broadcast Address|`192.168.12.191`|
**Subnetting Into Smaller Networks**

Let us now assume that we, as administrators, have been given the task of dividing the subnet assigned to us into 4 additional subnets. Thus, it is essential to know that we can only divide the subnets based on the binary system.

|**Exponent**|**Value**|
|---|---|
|2`^0`|= 1|
|2`^1`|= 2|
|2`^2`|= 4|
|2`^3`|= 8|
|2`^4`|= 16|
|2`^5`|= 32|
|2`^6`|= 64|
|2`^7`|= 128|
|2`^8`|= 256|
Therefore we can divide the `64 hosts` we know by `4`. The `4` is equal to the exponent 2`^2` in the binary system, so we find out the number of bits for the subnet mask by which we have to extend it. So we know the following parameters:

- Subnet: `192.168.12.128/26`
- Required Subnets: `4`

Now we increase/expand our subnet mask by `2 bits` from `/26` to `/28`, and it looks like this:

| **Details of** | **1st Octet** | **2nd Octet** | **3rd Octet** | **4th Octet** | **Decimal**         |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| IPv4           | 1100 0000     | 1010 1000     | 0000 1100     | 1000`\|` 0000 | 192.168.12.128`/28` |
| Subnet mask    | `1111 1111`   | `1111 1111`   | `1111 1111`   | `1111\|` 0000 | `255.255.255.240`   |
| Bits           | /8            | /16           | /24           | /32           |                     |
Next, we can divide the `64` IPv4 addresses that are available to us into `4 parts`:

|**Hosts**|**Math**|**Subnets**|**Host range for each subnet**|
|---|---|---|---|
|64|/|4|= `16`|
So we know how big each subnet will be. From now on, we start from the network address given to us (192.168.12.128) and add the `16` hosts `4` times:

|**Subnet No.**|**Network Address**|**First Host**|**Last Host**|**Broadcast Address**|**CIDR**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|`192.168.12.128`|192.168.12.129|192.168.12.142|`192.168.12.143`|192.168.12.128/28|
|2|`192.168.12.144`|192.168.12.145|192.168.12.158|`192.168.12.159`|192.168.12.144/28|
|3|`192.168.12.160`|192.168.12.161|192.168.12.174|`192.168.12.175`|192.168.12.160/28|
|4|`192.168.12.176`|192.168.12.177|192.168.12.190|`192.168.12.191`|192.168.12.176/28|

**Mental Subnetting**
It may seem like there is a lot of math involved in subnetting, but each octet repeats itself, and everything is a power of two, so there doesn't have to be a lot of memorization. The first thing to do is identify what octet changes.

|**1st Octet**|**2nd Octet**|**3rd Octet**|**4th Octet**|
|---|---|---|---|
|/8|/16|/24|/32|

It is possible to identify what octet of the IP Address may change by remembering those four numbers. Given the Network Address: `192.168.1.1/25`, it is immediately apparent that 192.168.2.4 would not be in the same network because the `/25` subnet means only the fourth octet may change.

The next part identifies how big each subnet can be but by dividing eight by the network and looking at the `remainder`. This is also called `Modulo Operation (%)` and is heavily utilized in cryptology. Given our previous example of `/25`, `(25 % 8)` would be 1. This is because eight goes into 25 three times (8 * 3 = 24). There is a 1 leftover, which is the network bit reserved for the network mask. There is a total of eight bits in each octet of an IP Address. If one is used for the network mask, the equation becomes 2^(8-1) or 2^7, 128. The table below contains all the numbers.

|**Remainder**|**Number**|**Exponential Form**|**Division Form**|
|---|---|---|---|
|0|256|2^8|256|
|1|128|2^7|256/2|
|2|64|2^6|256/2/2|
|3|32|2^5|256/2/2/2|
|4|16|2^4|256/2/2/2/2|
|5|8|2^3|256/2/2/2/2/2|
|6|4|2^2|256/2/2/2/2/2/2|
|7|2|2^1|256/2/2/2/2/2/2/2|

By remembering the powers of two up to eight, it can become an instant calculation. However, if forgotten, it may be quicker to remember to divide 256 in half the number of times of the remainder.

The tricky part of this is getting the actual IP Address range because 0 is a number and not null in networking. So in our `/25` with 128 IP Addresses, the first range is `192.168.1.0-127`. The first address is the network, and the last is the broadcast address, which means the usable IP Space would become `192.168.1.1-126`. If our IP Address fell above 128, then the `usable ip space` would be 192.168.129-254 (128 is the network and 255 is the broadcast).

# MAC Addresses
---
It's `48bit (6 octets) Media Access Control (MAC) address`. There are several standards for the MAC address:
- Ethernet (IEEE 802.3)
- Bluetooth (IEEE 802.15)
- WLAN (IEEE 802.11)
MAC address addresses the physical connection (network card, Bluetooth, or WLAN adapter). MAC address is configured by the manufacture but can be changed at least temporarily.

MAC address:

- `DE:AD:BE:EF:13:37`
- `DE-AD-BE-EF-13-37`
- `DEAD.BEEF.1337`

|**Representation**|**1st Octet**|**2nd Octet**|**3rd Octet**|**4th Octet**|**5th Octet**|**6th Octet**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Binary|1101 1110|1010 1101|1011 1110|1110 1111|0001 0011|0011 0111|
|Hex|DE|AD|BE|EF|13|37|
When an IP packet is delivered, it must be addressed on layer 2 to the destination host's physical address or to router / NAT. Each packet has a sender address and a destination.

MAC address is made out of 6 bytes. First 3 bytes are `Organization Unique Identifier (OUI)` defined by Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) for the respective manufacturers. The last half is called `Individual Address Part/Network Interface Controller (NIC)` which the manufacturers assign.

| **Representation** | **1st Octet** | **2nd Octet** | **3rd Octet** | **4th Octet** | **5th Octet** | **6th Octet** |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Binary             | `1101 1110`   | `1010 1101`   | `1011 1110`   | *1110 1111*     | *0001 0011*     | *0011 0111*     |
| Hex                | `DE`          | `AD`          | `BE`          | *EF*            | *13*            | *37*            |

If a host with the IP target address is located in the same subnet, the delivery is made directly to the target computer's physical address. However, if this host belongs to a different subnet, the Ethernet frame is addressed to the `MAC address` of the responsible router (`default gateway`). If the Ethernet frame's destination address matches its own `layer 2 address`, the router will forward the frame to the higher layers. `Address Resolution Protocol` (`ARP`) is used in IPv4 to determine the MAC addresses associated with the IP addresses.

As with IPv4 addresses, there are also certain reserved areas for the MAC address. These include, for example, the local range for the MAC.

|**Local Range**|
|---|
|0`2`:00:00:00:00:00|
|0`6`:00:00:00:00:00|
|0`A`:00:00:00:00:00|
|0`E`:00:00:00:00:00|
Furthermore, the last two bits in the first octet can play another essential role. The last bit can have two states, 0 and 1, as we already know. The last bit identifies the MAC address as `Unicast` (`0`) or `Multicast` (`1`). With `unicast`, it means that the packet sent will reach only one specific host.

### MAC multicast and broadcast

In `multicast` the packet is sent once to all hosts on the local network and then decides whether or not to accept the packet based on their configuration. Multicast is a unique address just like the broadcast. `Broadcast` is where data packets are transmitted simultaneously from one point to all members of a network. It is mainly used if receiver of the packet is not know. A good example is ARP (for MAC addresses) (also known as phone book of local address) and DHCP for IPv4 addresses protocols.

|Hex|`FF`|`FF`|`FF`|`FF`|`FF`|`FF`|

### OUI or  Locally administrated
The second last bit in the first octet identifies whether it is a `global OUI`, defined by the IEEE, or a `locally administrated` MAC address.

### Address Resolution Protocol
MAC addresses can be changed/manipulated or spoofed and should not be treated as identification or means of security. To protect network admins should segment network and use strong authentication protocols.

Some attacks:
- `MAC spoofing`: This involves altering the MAC address of a device to match that of another device, typically to gain unauthorized access to a network.
    
- `MAC flooding`: This involves sending many packets with different MAC addresses to a network switch, causing it to reach its MAC address table capacity and effectively preventing it from functioning correctly.
    
- `MAC address filtering`: Some networks may be configured only to allow access to devices with specific MAC addresses that we could potentially exploit by attempting to gain access to the network using a spoofed MAC address.

### Address Resolution Protocol
[Address Resolution Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol) (`ARP`) is a network protocol. It is an important part of the network communication used to resolve a network layer (layer 3) IP address to a link layer (layer 2) MAC address. It maps a host's IP address to its corresponding MAC address to facilitate communication between devices on a [Local Area Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network) (`LAN`). When a device on a LAN wants to communicate with another device, it sends a broadcast message containing the destination IP address and its own MAC address. The device with the matching IP address responds with its own MAC address, and the two devices can then communicate directly using their MAC addresses. This process is known as ARP resolution. It's more efficient to communicate using MAC addresses than using IP addresses.

#### ARP Request
When a device wants to communicate with another device on a LAN, it sends an ARP request to resolve the destination device's IP address to its MAC address. The request is broadcast to all devices on the LAN and contains the IP address of the destination device. The device with the matching IP address responds with its MAC address.

#### ARP Reply
When a device receives an ARP request, it sends an ARP reply to the requesting device with its MAC address. The reply message contains the IP and MAC addresses of both the requesting and the responding devices.
#### Tshark Capture

```
The "`who has`" message in the first and third lines indicates that a device is requesting the MAC address for the specified IP address, while the second and fourth lines show the ARP reply with the MAC address of the destination device. It's vulnerable to attacks such as `ARP Spoofing.`

`ARP spoofing`, also known as `ARP cache poisoning` or `ARP poison routing`, is an attack that can be done using tools like [Ettercap](https://github.com/Ettercap/ettercap) or [Cain & Abel](https://github.com/xchwarze/Cain) in which we send falsified ARP messages over a LAN. The goal is to associate our MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate device on the company's network, effectively allowing us to intercept traffic intended for the legitimate device. For example, this could look like the following:

```shell-session

```

The first and fourth lines show us (`10.129.12.100`) sending falsified ARP messages to the target, associating its MAC address with its IP address (`10.129.12.101`). The second and third lines show the target sending an ARP request and replying to our MAC address. This indicates that we have poisoned the target's ARP cache and that all traffic intended for the target will now be sent to our MAC address.

# IPv6 Addresses
---
IPv6 is 128bit long. The prefix identifies the host and network parts. Both IPv4 and IPv6 can be available simultaneously (dual stack). It also follows end to end encryption principle without the need for NAT.

`IPv6` is a protocol with many new features, which also has many other advantages over IPv4:
- Larger address space
- Address self-configuration (SLAAC)
- Multiple IPv6 addresses per interface
- Faster routing
- End-to-end encryption (IPsec)
- Data packages up to 4 GByte

| **Features**       | **IPv4**      | **IPv6**                     |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Bit length         | 32-bit        | 128 bit                      |
| OSI layer          | Network Layer | Network Layer                |
| Adressing range    | ~ 4.3 billion | ~ 340 undecillion            |
| Representation     | Binary        | Hexadecimal                  |
| Prefix notation    | 10.10.10.0/24 | fe80::dd80:b1a9:6687:2d3b/64 |
| Dynamic addressing | DHCP          | SLAAC / DHCPv6               |
| IPsec              | Optional      | Mandatory                    |
Four types of IPv6 addresses:

|**Type**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`Unicast`|Addresses for a single interface.|
|`Anycast`|Addresses for multiple interfaces, where only one of them receives the packet.|
|`Multicast`|Addresses for multiple interfaces, where all receive the same packet.|
|`Broadcast`|Do not exist and is realized with multicast addresses.|
IPv6 consists of 16 bytes and is represented in hexadecimal notation. 128bits are divided into 8block and multiplied by 16 bits (or 4 hex numbers). four hex numbers are grouped and separated by : however if the zeros are simplified to :: two colons.
- Full IPv6: `fe80:0000:0000:0000:dd80:b1a9:6687:2d3b/64`
- Short IPv6: `fe80::dd80:b1a9:6687:2d3b/64

IPv6 consists of two parts:
- Network prefix (network part)
- Interface Identified also called Suffix (host part)

The `Network Prefix` identifies the network, subnet, or address range. The `Interface Identifier` is formed from the `48-bit MAC` address (which we will discuss later) of the interface and is converted to a `64-bit address` in the process. The default prefix length is `/64`. However, other typical prefixes are `/32`, `/48`, and `/56`. If we want to use our networks, we get a shorter prefix (e.g. `/56`) than `/64` from our provider.

# Common Protocols
---
The two main types of connections used on networks are  **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)** and **User Datagram Protocol (UDP)** .
### TCP Transmission Control Protocol
TCP is a **connection-oriented** protocol which establishes virtual connection by using three-way-handshake. This connection is maintained until data transfer is complete and as long as the connection is active.

*For example*: When we enter URL into our web browser, the browser sends an HTTP request to the server hosting the website using TCP. The server responds by sending the HTML code for the website back to the browser using `TCP`. The browser then uses this code to render the website on our screen. This process relies on a `TCP` connection being established between the browser and the web server and maintained until the data transfer is complete. As a result, `TCP` is reliable but slower than UDP because it requires additional overhead for establishing and maintaining the connection.

### User Datagram Protocol
UDP is a connectionless protocols which means it does not require virtual connection before transmitting data. It sends packets without checking the destination.

Service like YouTube use UDP because video data can tolerate some data loss and it's speed is more important than reliability. It makes UDP faster than TCP but less reliable because there is no guarantee that packets will reach their destination.
