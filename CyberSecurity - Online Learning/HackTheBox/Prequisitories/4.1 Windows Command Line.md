# Introduction

There are two main built-in tools in windows and these are CMD and PowerShell.
- You can run CMD commands on PowerShell
- You can run PowerShell commands on CMD but you have to preface the command with PowerShell get-alias

| **PowerShell**                                                             | *Command Prompt*                                      |

# Command Prompt Basics
---
CMD allows to input commands that are directly interpreted and the executed by the OS. A single command can change user's password or check the status of NICs.

Local Access:
- Using the Windows key + `r` to bring up the run prompt, and then typing in `cmd`. OR
- Accessing the executable from the drive path `C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe`.

Remote Access:
- Secure Shell (`SSH`), `PsExec`, `WinRM`, `RDP`, or other protocols as needed

# Getting Help
---
```cmd-session
help time
```

Some commands use `/?` instead of help command #command 

```cmd
ipconfig /?
```

#### Command history
To display commands history: #command 
```cmd-session
donkey /history
```
`Donkey` is an MS-DOS utility that keeps a history of commands issued and allows them to be referenced again.

| **Key/Command** | **Description**                                                                                                            |
| :-------------: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| doskey /history | doskey /history will print the session's command history to the terminal or output it to a file when specified.            |
|     page up     | Places the first command in our session history to the prompt.                                                             |
|    page down    | Places the last command in history to the prompt.                                                                          |
|        ⇧        | Allows us to scroll up through our command history to view previously run commands.                                        |
|        ⇩        | Allows us to scroll down to our most recent commands run.                                                                  |
|        ⇨        | Types the previous command to prompt one character at a time.                                                              |
|        ⇦        | N/A                                                                                                                        |
|       F3        | Will retype the entire previous entry to our prompt.                                                                       |
|       F5        | Pressing F5 multiple times will allow you to cycle through previous commands.                                              |
|       F7        | Opens an interactive list of previous commands.                                                                            |
|       F9        | Enters a command to our prompt based on the number specified. The number corresponds to the commands place in our history. |
`ctrl+c` is how we interrupt a program effectively killing it


# System Navigation

List Directories #command 
```cmd-session
dir
```

Change directory #command 
```cmd-session
cd 
```

There is difference between absolute path and relative:
```cmd-session
cd C:\Users\htb\Pictures	                    and/or        

cd .\Pictures
```

To list all folder and files #command 
```cmd-session
tree /F
```
#### Interesting Directories
| Name:               | Location:                            | Description:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| %SYSTEMROOT%\Temp   | `C:\Windows\Temp`                    | Global directory containing temporary system files accessible to all users on the system. All users, regardless of authority, are provided full read, write, and execute permissions in this directory. Useful for dropping files as a low-privilege user on the system.         |
| %TEMP%              | `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Temp` | Local directory containing a user's temporary files accessible only to the user account that it is attached to. Provides full ownership to the user that owns this folder. Useful when the attacker gains control of a local/domain joined user account.                         |
| %PUBLIC%            | `C:\Users\Public`                    | Publicly accessible directory allowing any interactive logon account full access to read, write, modify, execute, etc., files and subfolders within the directory. Alternative to the global Windows Temp Directory as it's less likely to be monitored for suspicious activity. |
| %ProgramFiles%      | `C:\Program Files`                   | folder containing all 64-bit applications installed on the system. Useful for seeing what kind of applications are installed on the target system.                                                                                                                               |
| %ProgramFiles(x86)% | `C:\Program Files (x86)`             | Folder containing all 32-bit applications installed on the system. Useful for seeing what kind of applications are installed on the target system.                                                                                                                               |
# Working with Directories and Files
---
How to create new directory #command 
```cmd-session
md new-directory
```
How to remove directory #command 
```cmd-session
rd new-directory

rd /S new-directory
```

Move directory #command 
```cmd-session
move example C:\Users\htb\Documents\example
```

Copy directories #command 
```cmd-session
xcopy C:\Users\htb\Documents\example C:\Users\htb\Desktop\ /E
```
/E means to copy any files and subfolders and to include empty subfolder

Robocopy #command 
```cmd-session
robocopy C:\Users\htb\Desktop C:\Users\htb\Documents\
```
It can move files over the network, move them between drives or just simply move files locally retaining the file data and attributes to include timestamps , ownership, ACLs any files set like hidden or read-only.

#### Robocopy
As a user to use `Robocopy` we need to have `SeBackupPrivilege` and `auditing privilege` attributes otherwise the back up of files will fail

```cmd-session
C:\Users\htb\Desktop> robocopy /E /B /L C:\Users\htb\Desktop\example C:\Users\htb\Documents\Backup\

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   ROBOCOPY     ::     Robust File Copy for Windows                    
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Started : Monday, June 21, 2021 10:03:56 PM
   Source : C:\Users\htb\Desktop\example\
     Dest : C:\Users\htb\Documents\Backup\

    Files : *.*

  Options : *.* /L /S /E /DCOPY:DA /COPY:DAT /B /R:1000000 /W:30

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ERROR : You do not have the Backup and Restore Files user rights.
*****  You need these to perform Backup copies (/B or /ZB).

ERROR : Robocopy ran out of memory, exiting.
ERROR : Invalid Parameter #%d : "%s"

ERROR : Invalid Job File, Line #%d :"%s"


  Started : %s %s

   Source %c

     Dest %c
       Simple Usage :: ROBOCOPY source destination /MIR

             source :: Source Directory (drive:\path or \\server\share\path).
        destination :: Destination Dir  (drive:\path or \\server\share\path).
               /MIR :: Mirror a complete directory tree.

    For more usage information run ROBOCOPY /?


****  /MIR can DELETE files as well as copy them !
```

- Our permissions are insufficient.
- Using the /MIR switch will:
    - Complete the task by mirroring the source to the destination.
    - Mark files as a system backup and hide them from view.
- To clear these attributes, add the /A-
    
    switch to the command.
- Be cautious with the /MIR switch:
    - It will delete any files in the destination that are not in the source.
    - Ensure the destination folder is empty before copying.
- The /L switch was used to:
    - Show the potential result without executing the command.
- Let's try it below.

#### Files
To read  txt files #command 
```cmd-session
 more secrets.txt
```
`/S` will make the command print one line gap between text

Using pipes #command 
```cmd-session
ipconfig /all | more
```

To display content of text files #command 
```cmd-session
type bio.txt
```

To write to another files using the output #command 
```cmd-session
type passwords.txt >> secrets.txt
```

#### Create and Modify and Append Files

Echo to create and append files #command 
```cmd-session
echo Check out this text > demo.txt
```

Fsutil to create a file #command 
```cmd-session
fsutil file createNew for-sure.txt 222
```

To change file name #command 
```cmd-session
ren demo.txt superdemo.txt
```
Output to a file: #command 
```cmd-session
ipconfig /all > details.txt
```
Append to a file #command 
```cmd-session
C:\Users\htb\Documents> echo a b c d e > test.txt

C:\Users\htb\Documents>type test.txt
a b c d e

C:\Users\htb\Documents>echo f g h i j k see how this works now? >> test.txt

C:\Users\htb\Documents>type test.txt
a b c d e
f g h i j k see how this works now?
```

Pass a text file to a command #command 
```cmd-session
C:\Users\htb\Documents>find /i "see" < test.txt

f g h i j k see how this works now?
```
These were fairly simple commands, but remember that we can use `<` like this to search for keywords or strings in large text files, sort for unique items, and much more.

Pipe to another command #command 
```cmd-session
ipconfig /all | find /i "IPV4"
```

Run A Then B #command 
```cmd-session
ping 8.8.8.8 & type test.txt
```

we can use && if A succeeds then run B

Remove files #command 
```cmd-session
erase file-3 file-5
```

View Files with Read-only #command 
```cmd-session
dir /A:R
```

Delete any file with read-only #command 
```cmd-session
del /A:R *
```

View hidden files #command 
```cmd-session
dir /A:H
```

Copy and move files #command 
```cmd-session
copy calc.exe C:\Users\student\Downloads\copied-calc.exe /V
```

# Gathering System Information
---
Before we start looking through the system we need to have an idea of what we want to look into and what kind of information we can expect to get:
![[InformationTypesChart_Updated.webp]]

|Type|Description|
|---|---|
|`General System Information`|Contains information about the overall target system. Target system information includes but is not limited to the `hostname` of the machine, OS-specific details (`name`, `version`, `configuration`, etc.), and `installed hotfixes/patches` for the system.|
|`Networking Information`|Contains networking and connection information for the target system and system(s) to which the target is connected over the network. Examples of networking information include but are not limited to the following: `host IP address`, `available network interfaces`, `accessible subnets`, `DNS server(s)`, `known hosts`, and `network resources`.|
|`Basic Domain Information`|Contains Active Directory information regarding the domain to which the target system is connected.|
|`User Information`|Contains information regarding local users and groups on the target system. This can typically be expanded to contain anything accessible to these accounts, such as `environment variables`, `currently running tasks`, `scheduled tasks`, and `known services`.|
