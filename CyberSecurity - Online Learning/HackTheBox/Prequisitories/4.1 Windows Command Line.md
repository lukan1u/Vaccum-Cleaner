# Introduction
---

There are two main built-in tools in windows and these are CMD and PowerShell.
- You can run CMD commands on PowerShell
- You can run PowerShell commands on CMD but you have to preface the command with PowerShell get-alias

| **PowerShell**                                                             | *Command Prompt*                                      |

# Command Prompt Basics
---
CMD allows to input commands that are directly interpreted and the executed by the OS. A single command can change user's password or check the status of NICs.

Local Access:
- Using the Windows key + `r` to bring up the run prompt, and then typing in `cmd`. OR
- Accessing the executable from the drive path `C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe`.

Remote Access:
- Secure Shell (`SSH`), `PsExec`, `WinRM`, `RDP`, or other protocols as needed

# Getting Help
---
```cmd-session
help time
```

Some commands use `/?` instead of help command #command 

```cmd
ipconfig /?
```

Cheat Sheet - [ss64](https://ss64.com/nt/)

#### Command history
To display commands history: #command 
```cmd-session
donkey /history
```
`Donkey` is an MS-DOS utility that keeps a history of commands issued and allows them to be referenced again.

| **Key/Command** | **Description**                                                                                                            |
| :-------------: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| doskey /history | doskey /history will print the session's command history to the terminal or output it to a file when specified.            |
|     page up     | Places the first command in our session history to the prompt.                                                             |
|    page down    | Places the last command in history to the prompt.                                                                          |
|        ⇧        | Allows us to scroll up through our command history to view previously run commands.                                        |
|        ⇩        | Allows us to scroll down to our most recent commands run.                                                                  |
|        ⇨        | Types the previous command to prompt one character at a time.                                                              |
|        ⇦        | N/A                                                                                                                        |
|       F3        | Will retype the entire previous entry to our prompt.                                                                       |
|       F5        | Pressing F5 multiple times will allow you to cycle through previous commands.                                              |
|       F7        | Opens an interactive list of previous commands.                                                                            |
|       F9        | Enters a command to our prompt based on the number specified. The number corresponds to the commands place in our history. |
`ctrl+c` is how we interrupt a program effectively killing it


# System Navigation
---
List Directories #command 
```cmd-session
dir
```

Change directory #command 
```cmd-session
cd 
```

There is difference between absolute path and relative:
```cmd-session
cd C:\Users\htb\Pictures	                    and/or        

cd .\Pictures
```

To list all folder and files #command 
```cmd-session
tree /F
```
#### Interesting Directories
| Name:               | Location:                            | Description:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| %SYSTEMROOT%\Temp   | `C:\Windows\Temp`                    | Global directory containing temporary system files accessible to all users on the system. All users, regardless of authority, are provided full read, write, and execute permissions in this directory. Useful for dropping files as a low-privilege user on the system.         |
| %TEMP%              | `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Temp` | Local directory containing a user's temporary files accessible only to the user account that it is attached to. Provides full ownership to the user that owns this folder. Useful when the attacker gains control of a local/domain joined user account.                         |
| %PUBLIC%            | `C:\Users\Public`                    | Publicly accessible directory allowing any interactive logon account full access to read, write, modify, execute, etc., files and subfolders within the directory. Alternative to the global Windows Temp Directory as it's less likely to be monitored for suspicious activity. |
| %ProgramFiles%      | `C:\Program Files`                   | folder containing all 64-bit applications installed on the system. Useful for seeing what kind of applications are installed on the target system.                                                                                                                               |
| %ProgramFiles(x86)% | `C:\Program Files (x86)`             | Folder containing all 32-bit applications installed on the system. Useful for seeing what kind of applications are installed on the target system.                                                                                                                               |
# Working with Directories and Files
---
How to create new directory #command 
```cmd-session
md new-directory
```
How to remove directory #command 
```cmd-session
rd new-directory

rd /S new-directory
```

Move directory #command 
```cmd-session
move example C:\Users\htb\Documents\example
```

Copy directories #command 
```cmd-session
xcopy C:\Users\htb\Documents\example C:\Users\htb\Desktop\ /E
```
/E means to copy any files and subfolders and to include empty subfolder

Robocopy #command 
```cmd-session
robocopy C:\Users\htb\Desktop C:\Users\htb\Documents\
```
It can move files over the network, move them between drives or just simply move files locally retaining the file data and attributes to include timestamps , ownership, ACLs any files set like hidden or read-only.

#### Robocopy
As a user to use `Robocopy` we need to have `SeBackupPrivilege` and `auditing privilege` attributes otherwise the back up of files will fail

```cmd-session
C:\Users\htb\Desktop> robocopy /E /B /L C:\Users\htb\Desktop\example C:\Users\htb\Documents\Backup\

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   ROBOCOPY     ::     Robust File Copy for Windows                    
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Started : Monday, June 21, 2021 10:03:56 PM
   Source : C:\Users\htb\Desktop\example\
     Dest : C:\Users\htb\Documents\Backup\

    Files : *.*

  Options : *.* /L /S /E /DCOPY:DA /COPY:DAT /B /R:1000000 /W:30

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ERROR : You do not have the Backup and Restore Files user rights.
*****  You need these to perform Backup copies (/B or /ZB).

ERROR : Robocopy ran out of memory, exiting.
ERROR : Invalid Parameter #%d : "%s"

ERROR : Invalid Job File, Line #%d :"%s"


  Started : %s %s

   Source %c

     Dest %c
       Simple Usage :: ROBOCOPY source destination /MIR

             source :: Source Directory (drive:\path or \\server\share\path).
        destination :: Destination Dir  (drive:\path or \\server\share\path).
               /MIR :: Mirror a complete directory tree.

    For more usage information run ROBOCOPY /?


****  /MIR can DELETE files as well as copy them !
```

- Our permissions are insufficient.
- Using the /MIR switch will:
    - Complete the task by mirroring the source to the destination.
    - Mark files as a system backup and hide them from view.
- To clear these attributes, add the /A-
    
    switch to the command.
- Be cautious with the /MIR switch:
    - It will delete any files in the destination that are not in the source.
    - Ensure the destination folder is empty before copying.
- The /L switch was used to:
    - Show the potential result without executing the command.
- Let's try it below.

#### Files
To read  txt files #command 
```cmd-session
 more secrets.txt
```
`/S` will make the command print one line gap between text

Using pipes #command 
```cmd-session
ipconfig /all | more
```

To display content of text files #command 
```cmd-session
type bio.txt
```

To write to another files using the output #command 
```cmd-session
type passwords.txt >> secrets.txt
```

#### Create and Modify and Append Files

Echo to create and append files #command 
```cmd-session
echo Check out this text > demo.txt
```

Fsutil to create a file #command 
```cmd-session
fsutil file createNew for-sure.txt 222
```

To change file name #command 
```cmd-session
ren demo.txt superdemo.txt
```
Output to a file: #command 
```cmd-session
ipconfig /all > details.txt
```
Append to a file #command 
```cmd-session
C:\Users\htb\Documents> echo a b c d e > test.txt

C:\Users\htb\Documents>type test.txt
a b c d e

C:\Users\htb\Documents>echo f g h i j k see how this works now? >> test.txt

C:\Users\htb\Documents>type test.txt
a b c d e
f g h i j k see how this works now?
```

Pass a text file to a command #command 
```cmd-session
C:\Users\htb\Documents>find /i "see" < test.txt

f g h i j k see how this works now?
```
These were fairly simple commands, but remember that we can use `<` like this to search for keywords or strings in large text files, sort for unique items, and much more.

Pipe to another command #command 
```cmd-session
ipconfig /all | find /i "IPV4"
```

Run A Then B #command 
```cmd-session
ping 8.8.8.8 & type test.txt
```

we can use && if A succeeds then run B

Remove files #command 
```cmd-session
erase file-3 file-5
```

View Files with Read-only #command 
```cmd-session
dir /A:R
```

Delete any file with read-only #command 
```cmd-session
del /A:R *
```

View hidden files #command 
```cmd-session
dir /A:H
```

Copy and move files #command 
```cmd-session
copy calc.exe C:\Users\student\Downloads\copied-calc.exe /V
```

# Gathering System Information
---
Before we start looking through the system we need to have an idea of what we want to look into and what kind of information we can expect to get:
![[InformationTypesChart_Updated.webp]]

| Type                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `General System Information` | Contains information about the overall target system. Target system information includes but is not limited to the `hostname` of the machine, OS-specific details (`name`, `version`, `configuration`, etc.), and `installed hotfixes/patches` for the system.                                                                                           |
| `Networking Information`     | Contains networking and connection information for the target system and system(s) to which the target is connected over the network. Examples of networking information include but are not limited to the following: `host IP address`, `available network interfaces`, `accessible subnets`, `DNS server(s)`, `known hosts`, and `network resources`. |
| `Basic Domain Information`   | Contains Active Directory information regarding the domain to which the target system is connected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `User Information`           | Contains information regarding local users and groups on the target system. This can typically be expanded to contain anything accessible to these accounts, such as `environment variables`, `currently running tasks`, `scheduled tasks`, and `known services`.                                                                                        |
#### Getting system info
Getting general system info #command 
```
systeminfo
os
ver
```

#### Getting network info
To find network information #command 
```cmd-session
ipconfig
```

What devices it communicates with #command 
```cmd-session
arp /a
```
It's being used to map the network and understand what devices it was connected to or is connected to

#### Gathering user info
User name #command 
```cmd-session
whoami
```

To find out about the privileges for the account #command 
```cmd-session
whoami /priv
```

To find out about groups #command 
```cmd-session
whoami /groups
```

To display information of all users on a host #command 
```cmd-session
net user
```

To display all groups available on the host #command 
```cmd-session
net localgroup
```

To find shared resources #command 
```cmd-session
net share  
```

TO find out about the environment #command 
```cmd-session
net view
```


# Finding Files and Directories
---
#### Where
Looking for files using `where` #command 
```cmd-session
where calc.exe
```
The command will work depending whether the folder we looking through is in our environment variable path.
Using `/R` and a full path directory can help us find the file
```
where /R C:\Users\DaVinci\ windhawk_setup.exe
```
We can also look for things like file types  by running this command
```
where /R C:\Users\DaVinci\ *.exe
```

#### Find
Find is used to search for text strings or their absence within a file or files.
Looking for file using `find` #command 
```cmd-session
find "password" "C:\Users\student\not-passwords.txt" 
```
Parameter `/V` can be used as `Not` clause. It will only show us the lines that do not contain specific string. We can use `/N` to display line numbers and `/I` to ignore sensitivity.
```cmd-session
find /N /I /V "IP Address" example.txt  
```
There is also `findstr` which searches for patterns. It's like grep:
```cmd-session
findstr
```

#### Compare
Comp will each byte to find differences and then display them. Use `/A` modifier to see differences in ASCII format. Use `/L` to display line numbers.
To run `comp` #command 
```cmd-session
comp .\file-1.md .\file-2.md
```
Comparing different files
```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> echo a > .\file-1.md
PS C:\Users\MTanaka\Desktop> echo a > .\file-2.md
PS C:\Users\MTanaka\Desktop> comp .\file-1.md .\file-2.md /A
Comparing .\file-1.md and .\file-2.md...
Files compare OK
<SNIP>
PS C:\Users\MTanaka\Desktop> echo b > .\file-2.md
PS C:\Users\MTanaka\Desktop> comp .\file-1.md .\file-2.md /A
Comparing .\file-1.md and .\file-2.md...
Compare error at OFFSET 2
file1 = a
file2 = b  
```

FC will show you which lines are different
To run `fc` and compare lines #command 
```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> echo a > .\file-1.md
PS C:\Users\MTanaka\Desktop> echo a > .\file-2.md
PS C:\Users\MTanaka\Desktop> comp .\file-1.md .\file-2.md /A
Comparing .\file-1.md and .\file-2.md...
Files compare OK
<SNIP>
PS C:\Users\MTanaka\Desktop> echo b > .\file-2.md
PS C:\Users\MTanaka\Desktop> comp .\file-1.md .\file-2.md /A
Comparing .\file-1.md and .\file-2.md...
Compare error at OFFSET 2
file1 = a
file2 = b  
```

#### Sorting
We can use sort to receive input from console, pipeline or a file and sort it and send the results to the console or file or another command. It's being used with | < > 
To `sort` files #command 
```cmd-session
C:\Users\student\Desktop> type .\file-1.md
a
b
d
h
w
a
q
h
g

C:\Users\MTanaka\Desktop> sort.exe .\file-1.md /O .\sort-1.md
C:\Users\MTanaka\Desktop> type .\sort-1.md

a
a
b
d
g
h
h
q
w
```
Above, we can see using `sort` on the file `file-1.md` and then sending the result with the `/O` modifier to the file sort-1.md, we took our list of letters, sorted them in alphabetical order,
To sort only unique entries we use `/unique`
```cmd-session
C:\htb> type .\sort-1.md

a
a
b
d
g
h
h
q
w

PS C:\Users\MTanaka\Desktop> sort.exe .\sort-1.md /unique

a
b
d
g
h
q
w  
```

# Environment Variables
---
  Environment Variables are settings applied globally to the host. On Windows they are not case sensitive. Variables usually look like this: `%SUPER_IMPORTANT_VARIABLE%`.
  There is also variable SCOPE which devise variable into:
  - **Global scope** where it can be access and referenced the data stored inside the variable from anywhere within a program.
  - **Local scope** - Local variables can only be accessed within the function or block of code where they are defined. This means that these variables are not visible or usable outside of that specific function or block.
Global variable:
```cmd-session
echo %WINDIR%

| `System (Machine)` | The System scope contains environment variables defined by the Operating System (OS) and are accessible globally by all users and accounts that log on to the system. The OS requires these variables to function properly and are loaded upon runtime.                                                                                                                                           | Local Administrator or Domain Administrator                       | `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment` |
| `User`             | The User scope contains environment variables defined by the currently active user and are only accessible to them, not other users who can log on to the same system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Current Active User, Local Administrator, or Domain Administrator | `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment`                                                   |
| `Process`          | The Process scope contains environment variables that are defined and accessible in the context of the currently running process. Due to their transient nature, their lifetime only lasts for the currently running process in which they were initially defined. They also inherit variables from the System/User Scopes and the parent process that spawns it (only if it is a child process). | Current Child Process, Parent Process, or Current Active User     | `None (Stored in Process Memory)`                                                 |

Display all variables with `set and echo` #command 
Set
```
set 
%SYSTEMROOT%
```
Echo:
```
echo %PATH%
```

#### set vs setx
*set* makes the changes that are only *applied to current session* and will be removed once session is closed. *setx permanently* changes those variables.

Creating new variable or change #command 
```cmd-session
set DCIP=172.16.5.2
```

to verify this variable we can use `echo`
```cmd-session
echo %DCIP%
```

permanently create new variable or change:
```cmd-session
setx DCIP 172.16.5.2
```

remove variable #command 
```cmd-session
setx DCIP ""
```

#### Important Environment Variables
|Variable Name|Description|
|---|---|
|`%PATH%`|Specifies a set of directories(locations) where executable programs are located.|
|`%OS%`|The current operating system on the user's workstation.|
|`%SYSTEMROOT%`|Expands to `C:\Windows`. A system-defined read-only variable containing the Windows system folder. Anything Windows considers important to its core functionality is found here, including important data, core system binaries, and configuration files.|
|`%LOGONSERVER%`|Provides us with the login server for the currently active user followed by the machine's hostname. We can use this information to know if a machine is joined to a domain or workgroup.|
|`%USERPROFILE%`|Provides us with the location of the currently active user's home directory. Expands to `C:\Users\{username}`.|
|`%ProgramFiles%`|Equivalent of `C:\Program Files`. This location is where all the programs are installed on an `x64` based system.|
|`%ProgramFiles(x86)%`|Equivalent of `C:\Program Files (x86)`. This location is where all 32-bit programs running under `WOW64` are installed. Note that this variable is only accessible on a 64-bit host. It can be used to indicate what kind of host we are interacting with. (`x86` vs. `x64` architecture)|
[More info][https://ss64.com/nt/syntax-variables.html] -Using this information as a guide, we can start gathering any required information from these variables to help us learn about our host and its target environment inside and out.

# Managing Services
---
SC is a windows utility that allows us to query modify and manage host services locally and over the network.

To list all the services #coommand
```cmd-session
sc query type= service
```

To find if windows defender works #command 
```cmd-session
sc query windefend 
```

To stop service
```cmd-session
sc stop windefend
```

To start service
```
sc start windefend
```
Fun fact some services can only be stopped by `SYSTEM` machine account therefore even admins won't be able to do this.

Stopping Spooler Service
```cmd-session
sc stop windefend
```

#### Disabling Windows Updates Using SC
To configure services, we must use the [config](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/sc-config) parameter in `sc`. This will allow us to modify the values of existing services, regardless if they are currently running or not. All changes made with this command are reflected in the Windows registry as well as the database for Service Control Manager (`SCM`). Remember that all changes to existing services will only fully update after restarting the service.

|Service|Display Name|
|---|---|
|`wuauserv`|Windows Update Service|
|`bits`|Background Intelligent Transfer Service|
Disabling start up services #command 
```cmd-session
sc config bits start= disabled
```

List of current running services #command 
```cmd-session
tasklist /svc
```
Another command that does the smae
```cmd-session
net start
```
another command that gives full list of all services and their status #command 
```cmd-session
wmic service list brief
```

# Working With Scheduled Tasks
---
#### Triggers That Can Kick Off a Scheduled Task
- When a specific system event occurs.
- At a specific time.
- At a specific time on a daily schedule.
- At a specific time on a weekly schedule.
- At a specific time on a monthly schedule.
- At a specific time on a monthly day-of-week schedule.
- When the computer enters an idle state.
- When the task is registered.
- When the system is booted.
- When a user logs on.
- When a Terminal Server session changes state.

# CMD vs PowerShell
---

|**Feature**|**CMD**|**PowerShell**|
|---|---|---|
|Language|Batch and basic CMD commands only.|PowerShell can interpret Batch, CMD, PS cmdlets, and aliases.|
|Command utilization|The output from one command cannot be passed into another directly.|The output from one command can be passed into another directly.|
|Command Output|Text only|PowerShell outputs in object formatting.|
|Parallel Execution|CMD must finish one command before running another.|PowerShell can multi-thread commands to run in parallel.|
PowerShell has been built to be extensible and is also a scripting language. It's using the .NET framwork

Things that can be done on `PowerShell`:
- Provisioning servers and installing server roles
- Creating Active Directory user accounts for new employees
- Managing Active Directory group permissions
- Disabling and deleting Active Directory user accounts
- Managing file share permissions
- Interacting with [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) AD and Azure VMs
- Creating, deleting, and monitoring directories & files
- Gathering information about workstations and servers
- Setting up Microsoft Exchange email inboxes for users (in the cloud &/or on-premises)

#### Basic command  & Get-Help
Pressing `CRTL + Spacebar` Auto completes
Updating Help files for all tools to to learn tools better #command 
```powershell-session
Update-Help
```


To find where we are #command 
```
Get-Location
```

To list all directories #command 
```powershell-session
Get-ChildItem 
```

To change directory #command 
```powershell-session
Set-Location .\Documents\
```
Full path
```powershell
Set-Location C:\Users\DLarusso\Documents  
```

Display contents of a file #command 
```powershell-session
Get-Content Readme.md  
```

To remind us of other commands #command 
```powershell-session
Get-Command
```
To specify which get-command we are looking for:
```powershell-session
Get-Command -verb get
```
All options for windows:
```powershell-session
Get-Command -noun windows*  
```

History of commands #command 
```powershell-session
Get-History
```

With `PSReadLine`, however, that is not the case. `PSReadLine` stores everything in a file called `$($host.Name)_history.txt` located at `$env:APPDATA\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadLine`.

Viewing PSReadLineHistory
```powershell-session
get-content C:\Users\DLarusso\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadLine\ConsoleHost_history.txt
```
