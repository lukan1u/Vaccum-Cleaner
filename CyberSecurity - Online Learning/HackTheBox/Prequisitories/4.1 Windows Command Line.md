# Command Prompt Basics
---
CMD allows to input commands that are directly interpreted and the executed by the OS. A single command can change user's password or check the status of NICs.

Local Access:
- Using the Windows key + `r` to bring up the run prompt, and then typing in `cmd`. OR
- Accessing the executable from the drive path `C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe`.

Remote Access:
- Secure Shell (`SSH`), `PsExec`, `WinRM`, `RDP`, or other protocols as needed
