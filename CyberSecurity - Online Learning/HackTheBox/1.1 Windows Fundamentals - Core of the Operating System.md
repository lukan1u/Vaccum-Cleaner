# Operating system structure
Boot directory:

|Directory|Function|
|---|---|
|Perflogs|Can hold Windows performance logs but is empty by default.|
|Program Files|On 32-bit systems, all 16-bit and 32-bit programs are installed here. On 64-bit systems, only 64-bit programs are installed here.|
|Program Files (x86)|32-bit and 16-bit programs are installed here on 64-bit editions of Windows.|
|ProgramData|This is a hidden folder that contains data that is essential for certain installed programs to run. This data is accessible by the program no matter what user is running it.|
|Users|This folder contains user profiles for each user that logs onto the system and contains the two folders Public and Default.|
|Default|This is the default user profile template for all created users. Whenever a new user is added to the system, their profile is based on the Default profile.|
|Public|This folder is intended for computer users to share files and is accessible to all users by default. This folder is shared over the network by default but requires a valid network account to access.|
|AppData|Per user application data and settings are stored in a hidden user subfolder (i.e., cliff.moore\AppData). Each of these folders contains three subfolders. The Roaming folder contains machine-independent data that should follow the user's profile, such as custom dictionaries. The Local folder is specific to the computer itself and is never synchronized across the network. LocalLow is similar to the Local folder, but it has a lower data integrity level. Therefore it can be used, for example, by a web browser set to protected or safe mode.|
|Windows|The majority of the files required for the Windows operating system are contained here.|
|System, System32, SysWOW64|Contains all DLLs required for the core features of Windows and the Windows API. The operating system searches these folders any time a program asks to load a DLL without specifying an absolute path.|
|WinSxS|The Windows Component Store contains a copy of all Windows components, updates, and service packs.|
# File system

**Pros of NTFS**
- NTFS is reliable and can restore the consistency of the file system in the event of a system failure or power loss.
- Provides security by allowing us to set granular permissions on both files and folders.
- Supports very large-sized partitions.
- Has journaling built-in, meaning that file modifications (addition, modification, deletion) are logged.

**Cons of NTFS:**

- Most mobile devices do not support NTFS natively.
- Older media devices such as TVs and digital cameras do not offer support for NTFS storage devices.

|**Permission Type** |**Description** |
|---|---|
|Full Control|Allows reading, writing, changing, deleting of files/folders.|
|Modify|Allows reading, writing, and deleting of files/folders.|
|List Folder Contents|Allows for viewing and listing folders and subfolders as well as executing files. Folders only inherit this permission.|
|Read and Execute|Allows for viewing and listing files and subfolders as well as executing files. Files and folders inherit this permission.|
|Write|Allows for adding files to folders and subfolders and writing to a file.|
|Read|Allows for viewing and listing of folders and subfolders and viewing a file's contents.|
|Traverse Folder|This allows or denies the ability to move through folders to reach other files or folders. For example, a user may not have permission to list the directory contents or view files in the documents or web apps directory in this example c:\users\bsmith\documents\webapps\backups\backup_02042020.zip but with Traverse Folder permissions applied, they can access the backup archive.|
Files and folders *inherit the NTFS permissions of their parent folder* for ease of administration, so administrators do not need to explicitly set permissions for each file and folder.

# Integrity Control Access Control List (icacls)
To list permissions of  directories:
``` Lists chosen directory permissions
icacls C:\Windows
```

```

```cmd-session
c:\windows NT SERVICE\TrustedInstaller:(F)
           NT SERVICE\TrustedInstaller:(CI)(IO)(F)
           NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(M)
           NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(OI)(CI)(IO)(F)
           BUILTIN\Administrators:(M)
           BUILTIN\Administrators:(OI)(CI)(IO)(F)
           BUILTIN\Users:(RX)
           BUILTIN\Users:(OI)(CI)(IO)(GR,GE)
           CREATOR OWNER:(OI)(CI)(IO)(F)
           APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES:(RX)
           APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES:(OI)(CI)(IO)(GR,GE)
           APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL RESTRICTED APPLICATION PACKAGES:(RX)
           APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL RESTRICTED APPLICATION PACKAGES:(OI)(CI)(IO)(GR,GE)
```

**Inheritance from folders:**
- `(CI)`: container inherit
- `(OI)`: object inherit
- `(IO)`: inherit only
- `(NP)`: do not propagate inherit
- `(I)`: permission inherited from parent container
**Access to that specific folder etc**
- `F` : full access
- `D` :  delete access
- `N` :  no access
- `M` :  modify access
- `RX` :  read and execute access
- `R` :  read-only access
- `W` :  write-only access

# NTFS vs. Share Permissions
The Server Message Block protocol (**SMB**) is used in windows to connect shared resources like files and printers.

NTFS permissions are similar to share permissions however they are not the same.
**Share permissions:**

|Permission|Description|
|---|---|
|`Full Control`|Users are permitted to perform all actions given by Change and Read permissions as well as change permissions for NTFS files and subfolders|
|`Change`|Users are permitted to read, edit, delete and add files and subfolders|
|`Read`|Users are allowed to view file & subfolder contents|

**NTFS Basic permissions:**

|Permission|Description|
|---|---|
|`Full Control`|Users are permitted to add, edit, move, delete files & folders as well as change NTFS permissions that apply to all allowed folders|
|`Modify`|Users are permitted or denied permissions to view and modify files and folders. This includes adding or deleting files|
|`Read & Execute`|Users are permitted or denied permissions to read the contents of files and execute programs|
|`List folder contents`|Users are permitted or denied permissions to view a listing of files and subfolders|
|`Read`|Users are permitted or denied permissions to read the contents of files|
|`Write`|Users are permitted or denied permissions to write changes to a file and add new files to a folder|
|`Special Permissions`|A variety of advanced permissions options|
 
 **NTFS special permissions:**
 
|Permission|Description|
|---|---|
|`Full control`|Users are permitted or denied permissions to add, edit, move, delete files & folders as well as change NTFS permissions that apply to all permitted folders|
|`Traverse folder / execute file`|Users are permitted or denied permissions to access a subfolder within a directory structure even if the user is denied access to contents at the parent folder level. Users may also be permitted or denied permissions to execute programs|
|`List folder/read data`|Users are permitted or denied permissions to view files and folders contained in the parent folder. Users can also be permitted to open and view files|
|`Read attributes`|Users are permitted or denied permissions to view basic attributes of a file or folder. Examples of basic attributes: system, archive, read-only, and hidden|
|`Read extended attributes`|Users are permitted or denied permissions to view extended attributes of a file or folder. Attributes differ depending on the program|
|`Create files/write data`|Users are permitted or denied permissions to create files within a folder and make changes to a file|
|`Create folders/append data`|Users are permitted or denied permissions to create subfolders within a folder. Data can be added to files but pre-existing content cannot be overwritten|
|`Write attributes`|Users are permitted or denied to change file attributes. This permission does not grant access to creating files or folders|
|`Write extended attributes`|Users are permitted or denied permissions to change extended attributes on a file or folder. Attributes differ depending on the program|
|`Delete subfolders and files`|Users are permitted or denied permissions to delete subfolders and files. Parent folders will not be deleted|
|`Delete`|Users are permitted or denied permissions to delete parent folders, subfolders and files.|
|`Read permissions`|Users are permitted or denied permissions to read permissions of a folder|
|`Change permissions`|Users are permitted or denied permissions to change permissions of a file or folder|
|`Take ownership`|Users are permitted or denied permission to take ownership of a file or folder. The owner of a file has full permissions to change any permissions|

Permissions apply to the system where the folder is being stored. Also it is possible to set custom  permission on parent and subfolders if needed.
