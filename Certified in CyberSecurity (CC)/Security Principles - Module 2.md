## What is a risk?
- **Risk** is the measure of object's likelihood impact by the external factors that can have negative impact on the organisation.
-  **Information security risk** has a potential negative impact as a result of unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification or destruction of the data/information systems. *Risk = Threats: Impact/Likelihood*. IT risk is also a subset of business risk.

- **Vulnerability** is a weakness gap in organization's protection. 
- **Threat** is someone/something that aims to *exploit* the weakness to gain unauthorized access.
- **Asset** is something in need of protection.
- **Impact** the magnitude of harm caused to the organisation.
- **Likelihood** of occurrence is a weighted factor based on a subjective analysis of the probability that a given threat or set of threats is capable of exploiting a given vulnerability.
