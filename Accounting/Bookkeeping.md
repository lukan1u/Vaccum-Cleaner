### Accounting Process
1. **Source Documents**  
    Common source documents include:
    - Price Lists
    - Quotations
    - Invoices
    - Credit Notes
    - Delivery Notes
2. **Books of Prime Entry**  
    Information from *source documents* is recorded in Books of Prime Entry (e.g., Sales Journal, Cash Book). These can be updated daily, weekly, or monthly.
3. **Accounts & Trial Balance**  
    Transactions from books of prime entry are posted to individual accounts and periodically balanced. The totals are summarized in a **Trial Balance**.
4. **Financial Statements**  
    The **Trial Balance** helps calculate profit or loss, which is then used to prepare financial statements (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, etc.).
### Purchasing Documents
These documents help verify that goods or services were bought or sold under agreed-upon conditions:

1. **Price Lists** - Provide agreed prices for standard goods or services.
2. **Discount Policy** - An internal document specifying when the business will offer discounts to customers.
3. **Quotations** - Issued for one-off sales, where the price depends on the customer's specific needs or order.
4. **Purchase Order (PO)** - Confirms the customer’s agreement to the purchase and details the order terms.
5. **Customer Order** - The document detailing an order received from the customer.

When a customer agrees to purchase goods using a **Purchase Order**, it often means the goods are bought on **credit terms**. ***Credit Terms**: Goods or services are provided and invoiced, and payment is made at a later agreed-upon date.*

### Delivery Documents
Documents that prove what goods have been delivered to the customers 
- **Purchase Order**: Confirms the customer's agreement to purchase goods.
- **Delivery Note**: Confirms what goods were delivered; the customer receives this from the supplier and is responsible for notifying the supplier about any issues with the order.
- **Goods Received Note**: Written by the customer to confirm all goods were delivered correctly and specifies who checked the delivery.
- **Goods Returned Note**: Sent by the customer to the supplier to report any problems or issues with the received goods.
- **Invoice**: Sent to the customer after delivery, showing the amount due. It is calculated based on the purchase order, delivery note, and goods returned note.

### Invoice calculations
- Ensure all documents reference the same business address.
- Check that reference numbers match.
- Verify that all goods and product codes match.
- Confirm quantities match.
- Note any goods returned along with the reason.
- Ensure prices match.

**How to calculate invoice**
First, calculate the price for each product, factoring in any discounts. Then, total the discounted amounts and apply VAT at 20%. Each product’s price, including discounts, must be itemized on the invoice (before and after discount). The total after applying VAT represents the final amount the customer must pay. Credit notes are applied if any goods have been returned and they simple show to customers how much their payment has been reduced. If you can complete invoice you can complete credit note

### Discounts
There are three main discounts:
- Bulk discounts - given to customer on specific items bought in bulk
- Trade discounts - given to agreed customers and applied before VAT
- Prompt payment discounts - Given to the customers who paid quickly

#### Statement of Profit or Loss:
- **Income/Revenue**: Revenue sales, interest in the bank account, and sales of assets.
- **Expenses**: Day-to-day running costs such as electricity, purchases, and wages.
- Even though a van could be an asset when bought, there will be a separate account in the expenses for any van maintenance. The account will not be open under assets as it's not a running cost
#### Statement of Financial Position (aka Balance Sheet):
- **Assets**: Things we have such as buildings, cash, vans, receivables.
- **Liabilities**: What we owe, such as mortgages, loans, payables.
- **Equity (aka Capital)**: Owner's investment in the business.
### Capital vs Revenue Expenditure
**Capital Expenditure**
- Long-term assets that we buy and are listed on the statement of financial position as assets.
- Buying a computer/van that will last several years.
**Capital Income**
- Selling part of the business or selling a van.
**Revenue Expenditure**
- Income and costs of business activities shown on the statement of profit or loss.
- Paying electricity (running costs).
**Revenue Income**
- Sales and income from renting out a spare office.
- This shows investors whether the business did better this year or last year, etc.

### The Dual Effect of Transactions and the Accounting Equation
**Accounting equation**: $$\text{Assets} = \text{Liabilities} + \text{Capital}$$![[Pasted image 20241017125629.png]]
*Every transaction has a dual effect, i.e., the amount debited equals the amount credited to the accounts. The business is a separate entity from its owners, i.e., the accounting records must be kept separate from the owners’ personal affairs. This means that any capital invested by the owner is a liability for the business; the owner has effectively lent the money to the business as if the business were a separate person.*
