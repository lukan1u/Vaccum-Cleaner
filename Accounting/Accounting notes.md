### Accounting Process
1. **Source Documents**  
    Common source documents include:
    - Price Lists
    - Quotations
    - Invoices
    - Credit Notes
    - Delivery Notes
2. **Books of Prime Entry**  
    Information from *source documents* is recorded in Books of Prime Entry (e.g., Sales Journal, Cash Book). These can be updated daily, weekly, or monthly.
3. **Accounts & Trial Balance**  
    Transactions from books of prime entry are posted to individual accounts and periodically balanced. The totals are summarized in a **Trial Balance**.
4. **Financial Statements**  
    The **Trial Balance** helps calculate profit or loss, which is then used to prepare financial statements (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, etc.).
### Purchasing Documents
These documents help verify that goods or services were bought or sold under agreed-upon conditions:

1. **Price Lists** - Provide agreed prices for standard goods or services.
2. **Discount Policy** - An internal document specifying when the business will offer discounts to customers.
3. **Quotations** - Issued for one-off sales, where the price depends on the customer's specific needs or order.
4. **Purchase Order (PO)** - Confirms the customerâ€™s agreement to the purchase and details the order terms.
5. **Customer Order** - The document detailing an order received from the customer.

When a customer agrees to purchase goods using a **Purchase Order**, it often means the goods are bought on **credit terms**. ***Credit Terms**: Goods or services are provided and invoiced, and payment is made at a later agreed-upon date.*
